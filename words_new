tly we o ly offer our full time course because we do  t believe we could deliver a world class result o  a part time basis   yet  O e of the mai  problems people have i  teachi g themselves to code is

to apply each  ew co cept Our agile approach mea s we improve our course a d curriculum with each cohort  but you ca  get a flavour of the structure from our curriculum Yes  We have developed a part time PreCourse that  eeds to be completed before starti g the course  We focus o  the fou datio s  comma d li e  versio  co trol a d the basics of Ruby  The PreCourse requires a  average of       hours per week to complete successfully The fact that we ve had over     stude ts graduate from Makers Academy  a d our track record i  getti g stude ts hired at compa ies like BSkyB  Pivotal Labs  ThoughtWorks a d ma y other top tech compa ies mea  that YES  it is possible to lear  to code i     Weeks  Make  o mistake   it will be tough  It will take hard work a d dedicatio   but if you really wa t it  it s there to be had The course does  t just focus o  Ruby o  Rails  You ll lear  a  umber of la guages such as Ruby  HTML  CSS  JavaScript  jQuery a d more  but you re right i  sayi g that you will leave Makers Academy with Ruby as your stro gest la guage  However  we focus much of our efforts o  teachi g you the skills to thi k like a Developer   ote the capital D    a d our graduates have go e o  to work i  a  umber of programmi g la guages after leavi g Makers Academy Towards the e d of the course  stude ts work i  teams o  a project  Everyo e is i vited to pitch a    idea   a d after a couple of rou ds of voti g  we co struct teams based o  project choice  Two weeks later the team prese t their projects to frie ds a d family as part of their graduatio  While you ll get a

be for you We do touch o  Agile worki g methodologies a d eve  some Lea  Startup pri ciples  but this is  t the mai  focus of the course   or is desig   You will lear  some basic pri ciples i  all these areas  but this is primarily a course where you will lear  to code Our Net Promoter Score  as decided by feedback from all stude ts over the past year  is     The highest you ca  get is a      a

that is desig ed to o ly accept people who are serious about lear i g to code  but we ca  t always get it right There s  o such thi g as too old  Our stude ts are i credibly diverse   people of all
