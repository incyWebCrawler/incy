["The American view is very clear. Whether in code or en clair, the President will tell us all that UK membership of the EU is right for Britain, right for Europe, and right for America. And why? Because that – or so we will be told – is the only way we can have “influence” in the counsels of the nations.It is an important argument, and deserves to be taken seriously. I also think it is wholly fallacious – and coming from Uncle Sam, it is a piece of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America. This is a nation born from its glorious refusal to accept overseas control. Almost two and a half centuries ago the American colonists rose up and violently asserted the principle that they – and they alone – should determine the government of America, and not George III or his ministers. To this day the Americans refuse to kneel to almost any kind of international jurisdiction. Alone of Western nations, the US declines to accept that its citizens can be subject to the rulings of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. They have not even signed up to the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Can you imagine the Americans submitting their democracy to the kind of regime that we have in the EU?Think of Nafta – the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement – that links the US with Canada and Mexico. Suppose it were constituted on the lines of the EU, with a commission and a parliament and a court of justice. Would the Americans knuckle under – to a Nafta commission and parliament generating about half their domestic law? Would they submit to a Nafta court of justice – supreme over all US institutions – and largely staffed by Mexicans and Canadians whom the people of the US could neither appoint nor remove? No way. The idea is laughable, and completely alien to American traditions. So why is it essential for Britain to comply with a system that the Americans would themselves reject out of hand? Is it not a blatant case of “Do as I say, but not as I do”?Of course it is. As for this precious “influence”, so dearly bought, I am not sure that it is all it is cracked up to be – or that Britain’s EU membership is really so valuable to Washington. Since the very foundation of the Common Market, the Washington establishment has supported the idea of European integration. The notable state department figure George W Ball worked on drafting the Schuman plan in     . He was a pallbearer at the funeral of Jean Monnet, the architect of the European project.The Americans see the EU as a way of tidying up a continent whose conflicts have claimed huge numbers of American lives; as a bulwark against Russia, and they have always conceived it to be in American interests for the UK – their number one henchperson, their fidus Achates – to be deeply engaged. Symmetrically, it has been a Foreign Office superstition that we are more important to Washington if we can plausibly claim to have “influence” in Brussels. But with every year that passes that influence diminishes.It is not just that we are being ever more frequently outvoted in the council of ministers, and our officials ever more heavily outnumbered in the Commission. The whole concept of “pooling sovereignty” is a fraud and a cheat. We are not really sharing control with other EU governments: the problem is rather that all governments have lost control to the unelected federal machine. We don’t know who they are, or what language they speak, and we certainly don’t know what we can do to remove them at an election.\"There is a profound difference between the US and the EU, and one that will never disappear\"When Americans look at the process of European integration, they make a fundamental category error. With a forgivable narcissism, they assume that we Europeans are evolving – rather haltingly – so as to become just like them: a United States of Europe, a single federal polity. That is indeed what the eurozone countries are trying to build; but it is not right for many EU countries, and it certainly isn’t right for Britain.There is a profound difference between the US and the EU, and one that will never disappear. The US has a single culture, a single language, a single and powerful global brand, and a single government that commands national allegiance. It has a national history, a national myth, a demos that is the foundation of their democracy. The EU has nothing of the kind. In urging us to embed ourselves more deeply in the EU’s federalising structures, the Americans are urging us down a course they would never dream of going themselves. That is because they are a nation conceived in liberty. They sometimes seem to forget that we are quite fond of liberty, too.Now EU chiefs are struggling to remedy the defects in that project, and they have produced a report explaining what they want to do. It is called the “Five Presidents’ Report”, and it came out last year and got rather buried in the aftermath of the general election. History teaches us that we would be mad to ignore this text. The five presidents in question are those of the European Commission, the Council, the European Parliament, the European Central Bank and a body called the “European Stability Mechanism”. They want to prop up the euro by creating an all-out economic government of Europe.The EU referendum - in numbers They want a euro-area treasury, with further pooling of tax and budgetary policy. They want to harmonise insolvency law, company law, property rights, social security systems – and there is no way the UK can be unaffected by this process. As the Five Presidents put it: “Much can be already achieved through a deepening of the Single Market, which is important for all    EU member states.” So even though Britain is out of the euro, there is nothing we can do to stop our friends from using “single market” legislation to push forward centralising measures that will help prop up the euro (or so they imagine), by aligning EU economic, social and fiscal policies.Insofar as the recent “UK Agreement” has any force, it expressly allows these measures to be pursued, and agrees the UK will not attempt to exercise a veto. In other words we will find ourselves dragged along willy-nilly, in spite of all protestations to the contrary. So-called “Single Market” measures affect us as much as they affect the eurozone – and the question therefore is what we mean by “Single Market”. The answer is a mystery – because the single market has changed beyond recognition.Twenty years ago there was a clear conceptual difference in the EEC between things that were done at an intergovernmental level – between member states, without the Commission, the Euro-parliament and the Court of Justice – and things that were part of the “single market”. Foreign and defence co-operation was done intergovernmentally, and so was anything to do with police, or justice, or borders, or home affairs, or asylum, or immigration, or anything to do with human rights. Then there were all the fields of EEC competence: the common trade policies, the common agricultural policy, the competition policy, environment policy, and so on.Since Maastricht, that has all changed. Successive treaties have vastly expanded the areas in which the EU bodies operate so that there is virtually no aspect of public policy that is untouched. The EU now takes an interest in energy policy, in humanitarian aid, in education, in health, and in human rights of all kinds. There is a common European space policy. All of these policy areas involve the European Commission, the parliament, and above all the European Court of Justice. And remember – as soon as something enters within the EU’s field of competence, the Luxembourg Court of Justice becomes the supreme judicial body; and every time that happens, power is sucked away from this country.We have seen recently how the Home Secretary has lost the power to deport murderers, or to conduct surveillance of would-be terrorists, because that might put the UK in breach of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. What has that got to do with the “Single Market”, you may ask, and the answer is nothing at all. But any clever lawyer can easily blur the boundaries: it is a short hop from a common policy on free movement of workers to a common policy on deporting terrorists.The idea of the Single Market has become so capacious that it is a cloak for full-scale political and economic union. We now have up to half our law coming from the EU (some say two thirds); and if the Five Presidents get their way, the process of centralisation will simply continue – much of it in the name of the “Single Market”. It’s time we learnt the lesson. The federalists do mean it when they sketch out these programmes. The ratchet is clicking forwards. When you come to vote, the status quo is not on offer.The agents of Project Fear – and they seem to be everywhere – have warned us that leaving the EU would jeopardise police, judicial and intelligence cooperation. We have even been told that the EU has been responsible, over the last    years, for “keeping the peace in Europe”. In every case the message is that Brexit is simply too scary; and the reality is that these threats are so wildly exaggerated as to be nonsense.Indeed I am ever more convinced that the real risk is to sit back and do nothing, to remain inertly and complacently in an unreformed EU that is hell-bent on a federal project over which we have no control.Take the so-called economic risks. Remember when you weigh them up that the people now issuing the blood-curdling warnings against Brexit are often the very same (as the former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, just pointed out) as the people who prophesied disaster if Britain failed to join the euro. In fact, the opposite turned out to be true. It was the euro that proved to be a nightmare, an economic doomsday machine that is still causing low growth, high unemployment and real misery in some European countries.The single currency is also the cause of tensions between European countries, and rhetoric of a virulence and nastiness we have not seen since the second world war. We have had anti-German riots in Greece; we have seen Angela Merkel burned in effigy in Greece. In France, relations with Germany are said to be at a post-war nadir and support for the National Front is at an all-time high. Instead of recognising this disaster for what it is – the result of an over-centralising plan to fuse diverse economies into one – the EU is determined to keep going in the wrong direction.Francois Hollande is calling for a new federal parliament of the eurozone, and there are explicit plans to try to save the euro by creating an ever tighter political and fiscal union, with legislative consequences that would embroil Britain even though we are out of the eurozone.\"What we need to do now is screw up our courage and go for change.\"We stand on the brink of another huge new centralising leap – a leap in the dark, to coin a phrase – which means less democracy, less accountability and therefore a greater risk of disillusion and eventual political eruption. It isn’t Brexit that presents the economic risk; it is the euro, and the federalising attempts to save it that are the real long-term threat to security and stability.As for the notion that the EU is somehow the military guarantor of peace in Europe – remember what happened when the EU was entrusted with sorting out Yugoslavia. Remember Ukraine. It is Nato and the Atlantic alliance that underpins our security, as Maj Gen Julian Thompson outlines elsewhere in this paper today. EU pretensions in the area are at best confusing and at worst likely to encourage American disengagement.It is simply untrue, finally, to say that leaving the EU would make it impossible for us to concert our activities in intelligence or counter-terrorism or policing. All these operations can be conducted at an intergovernmental level – as indeed they used to be, until fairly recently.On the contrary, it is the European Court of Justice, with its vast new remit over the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is making it harder month by month for the security services to get on with their job – whether it be expelling murderers or monitoring terrorist suspects. It is the border-free Europe, obviously, that makes it so much easier for our enemies to move around. As Ronald K Noble, the former head of Interpol, has said, the Schengen area is “like a sign welcoming terrorists to Europe”.Whatever the risks of Brexit, they are eclipsed by the problems of remaining in a political construct that has changed out of all recognition since we joined in     . What we need to do now is screw up our courage and go for change. We need a new partnership and a new deal with our friends in the EU, based on trade and cooperation, but without this supranational apparatus that is so out of date and is imitated nowhere else.It is a once in a lifetime chance to energise our democracy, cut bureaucracy, save £  bn a year, control our borders and strike new trade deals with growth economies that are currently forbidden. Vote Leave would be good for Britain and the only way to jolt the EU into the reform it needs. Let’s call it Project Hope.Both scenarios sound nice. The trouble is, both are implausible.Article    of the Lisbon Treaty sets out a procedure for what happens if an EU member declares the intention to leave. It says that a negotiation takes place between the departing state and the rest of the EU to determine the terms of departure. Those negotiations have up to two years. If, after that time, no deal has been struck, the departing state’s EU membership automatically ceases, unless the member states vote unanimously to prolong the talks. Negotiation of better membership terms is not an option.That’s what the treaty says. Some might respond that what matters is the politics: the other    states all want the UK to stay in, so they would find a way to fudge the rules to let that happen.Well, perhaps. But let’s just think it through. One idea is that the Prime Minister might not actually trigger Article    in the event of a referendum vote to leave. He might say that he thinks British voters didn’t really mean it when they voted, and that he will go back to Brussels to seek a middle way.But that is politically untenable. The options in the referendum are to remain or to leave – not to try again. Most Leave campaigners – including perhaps the majority of Conservative activists – genuinely want to leave. Failure on the part of the Prime Minister to act upon the expressed will of the people would cause uproar.So in the event of a Leave vote, the Prime Minister must trigger Article   .That leaves an alternative scenario: the prime minister triggers Article    and formally declares the UK’s intention to leave, but then he works with his fellow EU leaders not on Brexit terms, but on improved membership terms.\"There is only one way to get the change we need, and that is to vote to go, because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says No\"Boris JohnsonOne problem with this is legal: once a member state has declared its intention to leave, there is no mechanism to withdraw that declaration and prevent exit. Maybe the courts would think such a mechanism is implied – but we don’t know. If not, we would depend on perpetual extensions of the two-year post-declaration membership window – which, remember, can at any time be vetoed by a single member-state.This gets to another political problem: the two-year limit and the requirement for unanimity to extend that limit make the UK’s negotiating position in this scenario very weak.And if our membership lapses with no deal done, we are obliged under World Trade Organisation rules immediately to impose tariffs on our trade with EU countries. That harms us much more than it harms many of those countries. There is no guarantee in this situation that the UK could strike a better deal at all.The same problems apply to the idea of choosing at a second referendum between the negotiated Brexit terms and continued membership. The UK has no clear legal right to reverse its initial decision. A way of fudging that might be found. But it would require unanimous support of the   , which squeezes the UK’s power to bargain for a decent deal.In short, a vote to leave is a vote to leave. Anyone who says otherwise is playing with fire.Alan Renwick is deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College LondonAs new countries have joined, we have seen a hurried expansion in the areas for Qualified Majority Voting, so that Britain can be overruled more and more often (as has happened in the past five years). We have had not just the Maastricht Treaty, but Amsterdam, Nice, Lisbon, every one of them representing an extension of EU authority and a centralisation in Brussels. According to the House of Commons library, anything between    and    per cent of UK legislation now comes from the EU; and remember that this type of legislation is very special.It is unstoppable, and it is irreversible – since it can only be repealed by the EU itself. Ask how much EU legislation the Commission has actually taken back under its various programmes for streamlining bureaucracy. The answer is none. That is why EU law is likened to a ratchet, clicking only forwards. We are seeing a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation, as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy. Then – and this is the key point – the EU acquires supremacy in any field that it touches; because it is one of the planks of Britain’s membership, agreed in     , that any question involving the EU must go to Luxembourg, to be adjudicated by the European Court of Justice.\"At a time when Brussels should be devolving power, it is hauling more and more towards the centre, and there is no way that Britain can be unaffected\"Boris JohnsonIt was one thing when that court contented itself with the single market, and ensuring that there was free and fair trade across the EU. We are now way beyond that stage. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the court has taken on the ability to vindicate people’s rights under the   -clause “Charter of Fundamental Human Rights”, including such peculiar entitlements as the right to found a school, or the right to “pursue a freely chosen occupation” anywhere in the EU, or the right to start a business.These are not fundamental rights as we normally understand them, and the mind boggles as to how they will be enforced. Tony Blair told us he had an opt-out from this charter.Alas, that opt-out has not proved legally durable, and there are real fears among British jurists about the activism of the court. The more the EU does, the less room there is for national decision-making. Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating – like the time I discovered, in     , that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.Sometimes the public can see all too plainly the impotence of their own elected politicians – as with immigration. That enrages them; not so much the numbers as the lack of control. That is what we mean by loss of sovereignty – the inability of people to kick out, at elections, the men and women who control their lives. We are seeing an alienation of the people from the power they should hold, and I am sure this is contributing to the sense of disengagement, the apathy, the view that politicians are “all the same” and can change nothing, and to the rise of extremist parties.Democracy matters; and I find it deeply worrying that the Greeks are effectively being told what to do with their budgets and public spending, in spite of huge suffering among the population. And now the EU wants to go further. There is a document floating around Brussels called “The Five Presidents Report”, in which the leaders of the various EU institutions map out ways to save the euro. It all involves more integration: a social union, a political union, a budgetary union. At a time when Brussels should be devolving power, it is hauling more and more towards the centre, and there is no way that Britain can be unaffected.David Cameron has done his very best, and he has achieved more than many expected. There is some useful language about stopping “ever-closer union” from applying to the UK, about protecting the euro outs from the euro ins, and about competition and deregulation.There is an excellent forthcoming Bill that will assert the sovereignty of Parliament, the fruit of heroic intellectual labour by Oliver Letwin, which may well exercise a chilling effect on some of the more federalist flights of fancy of the court and the Commission. It is good, and right, but it cannot stop the machine; at best it can put a temporary and occasional spoke in the ratchet.There is only one way to get the change we need, and that is to vote to go, because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says No. The fundamental problem remains: that they have an ideal that we do not share. They want to create a truly federal union, e pluribus unum, when most British people do not.It is time to seek a new relationship, in which we manage to extricate ourselves from most of the supranational elements. We will hear a lot in the coming weeks about the risks of this option; the risk to the economy, the risk to the City of London, and so on; and though those risks cannot be entirely dismissed, I think they are likely to be exaggerated. We have heard this kind of thing before, about the decision to opt out of the euro, and the very opposite turned out to be the case.I also accept there is a risk that a vote to Leave the EU, as it currently stands, will cause fresh tensions in the union between England and Scotland. On the other hand, most of the evidence I have seen suggests that the Scots will vote on roughly the same lines as the English.We will be told that a Brexit would embolden Putin, though it seems to me he is more likely to be emboldened, for instance, by the West’s relative passivity in Syria.Above all, we will be told that whatever the democratic deficiencies, we would be better off remaining in because of the “influence” we have. This is less and less persuasive to me. Only   per cent of people running the Commission are UK nationals, when Britain contains    per cent of the EU population. It is not clear why the Commission should be best placed to know the needs of UK business and industry, rather than the myriad officials at UK Trade & Investment or the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.If the “Leave” side wins, it will indeed be necessary to negotiate a large number of trade deals at great speed. But why should that be impossible? We have become so used to Nanny in Brussels that we have become infantilised, incapable of imagining an independent future. We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny Civil Service. Are we really unable to do trade deals? We will have at least two years in which the existing treaties will be in force.\"This is a moment for Britain to be brave, to reach out – not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else\"Boris JohnsonThe real risk is to the general morale of Europe, and to the prestige of the EU project. We should take that seriously.We should remember that this federalist vision is not an ignoble idea. It was born of the highest motives – to keep the peace in Europe. The people who run the various EU institutions – whom we like to ply with crass abuse – are, in my experience, principled and thoughtful officials. They have done some very good things: I think of the work of Sir Leon Brittan, for instance, as Competition Commissioner, and his fight against state aid.They just have a different view of the way Europe should be constructed. I would hope they would see a vote to leave as a challenge, not just to strike a new and harmonious relationship with Britain (in which those benefits could be retained) but to recover some of the competitiveness that the continent has lost in the last decades.Whatever happens, Britain needs to be supportive of its friends and allies – but on the lines originally proposed by Winston Churchill: interested, associated, but not absorbed; with Europe – but not comprised. We have spent     years trying to stop continental European powers uniting against us. There is no reason (if everyone is sensible) why that should happen now, and every reason for friendliness.EU: How the Cabinet will vote For many Conservatives, this has already been a pretty agonising business. Many of us are deeply internally divided, and we are divided between us. We know that we do not agree on the substance, but I hope we can all agree to concentrate on the arguments; to play the ball and not the man.At the end of it all, we want to get a result, and then get on and unite around David Cameron – continuing to deliver better jobs, better housing, better health, education and a better quality of life for our constituents for whom (let’s be frank) the EU is not always the number one issue.It is entirely thanks to the Prime Minister, his bravery and energy, and the fact that he won a majority Conservative government, that we are having a referendum at all. Never forget that if it were down to Jeremy Corbyn and the so-called People’s Party, the people would be completely frozen out.This is the right moment to have a referendum, because as Europe changes, Britain is changing too. This is a truly great country that is now going places at extraordinary speed. We are the European, if not the world, leaders in so many sectors of the   st-century economy; not just financial services, but business services, the media, biosciences, universities, the arts, technology of all kinds (of the    EU technology companies worth more than $  billion,    are British); and we still have a dizzyingly fertile manufacturing sector.Now is the time to spearhead the success of those products and services not just in Europe, but in growth markets beyond. This is a moment to be brave, to reach out – not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.EU referendum countdown We have given so much to the world, in ideas and culture, but the most valuable British export and the one for which we are most famous is the one that is now increasingly in question: parliamentary democracy – the way the people express their power.This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to vote for real change in Britain’s relations with Europe. This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule. A vote to Remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy.In the next few weeks, the views of people like me will matter less and less, because the choice belongs to those who are really sovereign – the people of the UK. And in the matter of their own sovereignty the people, by definition, will get it right.EU referendum: Timeline The awful truth was that they were right. A real bank meltdown would have had unbearable consequences for vast numbers of working people. The politicians stepped in to rescue the banks. So it was no surprise that the next target was the politicians.When the expenses scandal broke at Westminster, the place was virtually engulfed in the fireball of rage. Famous names were humiliated; many MPs lost their jobs; some went to prison. And that was at least partly right, and sensible. The stables needed to be cleaned. In some cases there had been gross peculation and abuse of the system. But after a while a sense of injustice – of unfairness – started to burn in the breasts of some MPs, a feeling that the whole of Parliament was being dragged through the mud, when many MPs felt (rightly or wrongly) they had been only following the rules as they understood them.They were being made to feel dirty, and criminal, when they had spent years working hard for their constituents. They felt aggrieved. And as in some Aeschylean tragedy, it was that sense of injustice that began to breed a desire for revenge; and it was not long before the politicians found their target. The great British bouncing cannonball of rage moved on – to the very people who had unleashed the expenses scandal. It seemed that Fleet Street had been involved in its own unethical practices – hacking into the phones of celebrities and members of the Royal family, as well as people who had never courted publicity.They had apparently been trying to listen to the voicemails not just of criminals, but also of victims of crime. They had been ruthlessly breaching the privacy of ordinary people for the sake of circulation and profits. They had been paying public officials for information. Before long we had the Leveson inquiry, and journalists were appearing in court, and in a few cases going to prison. Again, to some extent this was necessary, and inevitable. Some journalists had become much too blasé about the legality of their methods. In an age of electronic surveillance and mobile phones, new boundaries had to be set.Again, however, the law of oversteer began to apply. Some journalists began to feel that it was all going a bit far – that they were being persecuted for doing their job, for trying to keep tabs on the famous and powerful, for trying to bring new facts into the public domain. Honest journalists were shocked to find their homes raided at  am, their computers taken for inspection by the police, their neighbours scandalised. Like those bankers who had never had anything to do with a CDO, like the MPs who had done nothing but serve their constituents, there were many journalists who had never done anything illegal or even unscrupulous.Once again resentment started to burn; and the great vengeful cannonball of rage was about to crash into a new target. There was one mighty British institution that had spent this entire period observing the various disasters in a spirit of smug and superior detachment. The BBC had luxuriated in the downfall of the bankers; it had vastly enjoyed the humiliation of the MPs; and it had every reason (not least a commercial one) to feel tremendous satisfaction at the way the hacking scandal had unfolded. So when truth about Jimmy Savile became widely known, and the BBC was engulfed in flames, there were plenty of people who warmed their hands at the blaze.Again, there was at least in some cases an evil that needed to be exposed. It is now clear that famous names were able to get away with appalling abuse of young people, partly because of a BBC blind-eye culture. Some have now gone to prison. The investigations into historic child abuse have widened – to the point, again, where some feel the whole thing has gone too far. Like those bankers, MPs or journalists who believe themselves to have been deeply wronged, there are those who feel they have come under suspicion in a way that is horrible and unfair. They feel a sense of swelling injustice and rage.\"It is one of the great things about this country that we hold all our institutions to account – ferociously\"They have a new target. Like sections of the media, their wrath has been turned on the police! The cannonball of rage is now bouncing around Scotland Yard. Balance is required. As the police have acknowledged, some of the investigations could have been better handled; some of the criticism strikes me as deeply unfair. It is one of the great things about this country that we hold all our institutions to account – ferociously. But beware the phenomenon of oversteer.The choice is really quite simple. In favour of staying, it is in Britain’s geo-strategic interests to be pretty intimately engaged in the doings of a continent that has a grim   th-century history, and whose agonies have caused millions of Britons to lose their lives. History shows that they need us. Leaving would be widely read as a very negative signal for Europe. It would dismay some of our closest friends, not least the eastern Europeans for whom the EU has been a force for good: stability, openness, and prosperity.It is also true that the single market is of considerable value to many UK companies and consumers, and that leaving would cause at least some business uncertainty, while embroiling the Government for several years in a fiddly process of negotiating new arrangements, so diverting energy from the real problems of this country – low skills, low social mobility, low investment etc – that have nothing to do with Europe.Against these points we must enter the woeful defects of the EU. It is manifestly undemocratic and in some ways getting worse. It is wasteful, expensive and occasionally corrupt. The Common Agricultural Policy is iniquitous towards developing countries. The EU is legislating over an ever wider range of policy areas, now including human rights, and with Britain ever more frequently outvoted. There is currently no effective means of checking this one-way ratchet of growth-strangling regulation, and to make matters worse the EU is now devoting most of its intellectual energy to trying to save the euro, a flawed project from which we are thankfully exempt. The EU’s share of global trade is diminishing, and the people who prophesy doom as a result of Brexit are very largely the same people who said we should join the euro.So there is the dilemma in a nutshell: Britain in the EU good, in so far as that means helping to shape the destiny of a troubled continent in uncertain times, while trading freely with our partners. Britain in the EU bad, in so far as it is a political project whose destiny of ever-closer union we don’t accept and whose lust to regulate we can’t stop.That is why for the last couple of years I have argued that we would be – on the whole – better off in a reformed EU, but that Britain could have a great future outside. In deciding how to vote I (and I expect a few others) will want to know whether we have genuinely achieved any reform, and whether there is the prospect of any more. So let’s look at the Tusk proposals, in turn, and ask some hard questions.\"EU leaders have apparently agreed that the phrase “ever-closer union” should no longer serve as a signpost for integration\"First: this “protection” for the UK and other countries that don’t use the euro: is it a concession by them, or by us? The salient point appears to be that the UK will not be able to block moves to create a fiscal union – a deeply anti-democratic exercise. Do we really think that they should be able to use EU institutions, which we share, to centralise tax and budgetary powers? Why? And what does it all mean for the City? What are these new “macro-prudential” powers over banks that Brussels seems to want?Next: competitiveness. The language is excellent. Tusk talks about lowering administrative burdens, cutting compliance costs and repealing unnecessary legislation. Very good. But we have heard this kind of thing for a while. How many laws has the EU actually repealed, what are they, and why should we believe that this process will accelerate? Why are we not insisting on a timetable for a real single market in services?On sovereignty, it looks as though the Prime Minister has done better than many expected, in that EU leaders have apparently agreed that the phrase “ever-closer union” should no longer serve as a signpost for integration. That is potentially very important, since the European Court has often made use of the phrase in advancing its more aggressively federalist judgments. But how bankable is this? Will it be engraved in the treaties? Will the court be obliged to take account of this change, or will it be blown away – like Tony Blair’s evanescent opt-out from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights? How can we restore the force of that Lisbon opt-out, and stop the court making rulings on human rights? In asserting Parliament’s sovereignty, how can we construct something that will be truly intimidating both to the law-making activism of the commission and the judicial activism of the court? Are we talking bazooka or popgun?Last, on borders, we seem to have accepted the mantra that “free movement” is an age-old inviolable principle of the EU. This is not quite so. Until recently it only applied to “workers” rather than all EU citizens. Why didn’t we try harder to recapture control of our borders, rather than stick at this minor (if worthwhile) change to the law on benefits? There may be a good explanation, but we need to hear it.These are the questions I pose, humbly and respectfully. Let’s hope for some answers in the next fortnight.Renegotiation of Britain's EU membership We have all become accustomed to automatic ticketing, whether by Oyster or bank card or mobile. Old ticket offices will now serve as coffee shops, and heel bars, and mini-markets and newsagents and click-and-collect depots. The new businesses will pay rents to TfL (and corporation tax to the Government) and they will be of considerably more value to passengers than keeping staff trapped behind plate glass.So why go on strike? No one – not even the union members – seriously believes that the action will achieve a darned thing. The strike promises to be nothing more than a pointless inconvenience. Everyone sensible has condemned it – including Zac Goldsmith, who I hope will follow me as Mayor of London.There is one glaring exception, one voice we need to hear – and that is the candidate of the Labour party, Sadiq Khan. Why won’t he just say unequivocally, loud and clear, that the RMT leadership is wrong to put its members through this madness – not to mention the travelling public? Come on, Khan: man up. This is a golden opportunity to make a statement of the blindingly obvious. Denounce this bonkers strike.Will he? Of course not. He will weasel around with all sorts of nonsense about how he would “get people round the table” or “bang heads together” – all of which blather achieves nothing except to undermine TfL management. He’ll blame TfL. He will blame me (of course!). He will blame everyone except the people responsible – the leadership of the RMT.He would not dream of coming straight out and condemning this nonsensical strike because he is the creature of the unions; he is their patsy and their plaything. Of course he is. They bought him when they paid £   ,    into his Mayoral campaign coffers – Unite, TSSA, the lot of them.How can anyone rely on Sadiq Khan to make sensible use of technology and drive forward the modernisation of the underground? Every single one of these changes – from ticket office closures to the Night Tube to automation of the trains – has been achieved in the teeth of union resistance. Look at the record: what happened when Labour last ran London.Transport for London officials first proposed closure of ticket offices to Ken Livingstone, more than    years ago. He nervously agreed – then chickened out when his union chums cut up rough. It was way back in     , under Livingstone, that Tube management suggested they might be able to run services late on Friday and Saturday nights (though not yet a full Night Tube).Livingstone announced the plan – and then had to drop it when the unions refused to play ball. I am reliably informed – and the Labour candidate should be volubly challenged on this point – that Sadiq Khan has promised Livingstone that he will make him the chair of TfL. They are trying to put the band back together!\"There is a huge risk that London is about to lurch backwards to the Jurassic age, ruled by saurian socialists such as Livingstone and Corbyn\"We now need to proceed with full automation of the service, like the best Asian metros, with driverless trains. Of course the unions hate the idea, even though it would deliver a better, faster and more reliable service. Can you imagine Khan, or the unions – let alone Livingstone – allowing it to happen?Khan wants to bring back “check-off” to make it easier for unions to take subs from employees; he wants electronic balloting for strikes, to make them easier to hold. His policies would cost TfL billions, and to cap it all he wants to take £ bn out of the fare box with his unaffordable fares freeze. That would make it impossible to deliver some of the big-ticket transport improvements that are so vital for building the housing London needs.How would Khan and Labour try to plug the gap? By whacking up council tax or putting in new congestion charges. Even then it wouldn’t add up. They would certainly have to look at taking away much-loved concessions such as the Freedom Pass.There is a huge risk that London is about to lurch backwards to the Jurassic age, ruled by saurian socialists such as Livingstone and Corbyn. Passengers who desperately need continued improvement are in danger of becoming Labour’s lab rats – a Corbynista experiment under Khan. Don’t let it happen. Back Zac and crack on with modernising the greatest city on earth.Omigosh – what a contest; and what a dilemma for us all! Your eyes flit desperately between them, and for many people it will be an eerie feeling: the first time they have ever been tempted to side with Brussels over anything. Margrethe has made an extraordinary demand. She wants Apple to pay the Irish state an infarct-inducing sum in back taxes – between $  and $   billion, and I know that many of you will egg her on. Yee-hah, Margrethe, you will be saying. Go on, darling. You fine them. You tax them. You show those overmighty Yankee tech giants that someone, somewhere, will finally stand up to them.Are you in that camp? If you are, I can understand why. About a month ago the bankers Goldman Sachs published a list of the biggest and richest firms in the world. The top three, in order, were Apple, Google and Microsoft – and Facebook and Amazon were also in the top   . All these tech companies make staggering sums from an avid British population. We love this stuff. We can’t get enough of it. We buy tens of billions of pounds’ worth of American hardware, software and services – and yet these companies pay quite derisory sums in tax to the UK Exchequer: derisory, that is, when you consider how much dosh they are earning from us all.Google has just agreed to stump up an extra £    million, to compensate for underpayments over the past nine years; and if its executives were expecting applause from the public, they must be disappointed today. They got a raspberry, and everyone is complaining that it isn’t enough, that it still amounts to a tax rate of only about   per cent on earnings.\"The Commission is plainly using the EU treaty articles on state aid to intervene in the tax jurisdiction of a member state when strictly speaking, it seems to me, they should butt right out\"There is a widespread feeling that the loopholes and dodges should be axed, and that they should be paying more. To a large extent I agree. It has never seemed fair that some of these companies – no matter how wonderful the service they provide – should be paying so much less in tax than the high-street tea rooms and bookshops they have pulverised. It would be a good thing, both for the UK finances and for the image of these great companies, if they paid more.And yet I must confess there is a part of me that sides strongly with Tim Cook and Apple – or at least can see his point of view. It is absurd to blame the company for “not paying their taxes”. You might as well blame a shark for eating seals. It is the nature of the beast; and not only is it the nature of the beast – it is the law. It is the fiduciary duty of their finance directors to minimise tax exposure. They have a legal obligation to their shareholders. Tax is not paid on the basis of what “feels right” either to public opinion or to politicians. It is not some eleemosynary contribution. It is not as if we are all in church, and watching beadily to make sure that Tim Cook puts his £   note into the collection basket. Tax is paid, and must be paid, in accordance with the strict requirements of the system. And the second reason for sympathising with Apple, and not Margrethe the crusading Danish commissioner, is that in my view this dispute should have nothing to do with Brussels.The Commission is plainly using the EU treaty articles on state aid to intervene in the tax jurisdiction of a member state when strictly speaking, it seems to me, they should butt right out. The paradox of this whole case is that the Irish and Apple are on the same side. If Margrethe the Commissioner makes Apple give Dublin $   billion in back taxes, that will actually be against the wishes of the Irish government.The Irish decided they wanted to go for an ultra-low corporation tax, at   .  per cent. It was their sovereign ambition to attract the HQ of Apple and others. They wanted Irish taxi drivers to have the honour of ferrying Apple executives around, and they wanted Irish waitresses to snaffle their huge tips. The EU Commission is partly excited by the chance to bash a corporate American giant; but mainly it is a chance to attack tax arbitrage between member states – to move ever closer towards uniformity and away from a spirit of healthy competition between jurisdictions.We need that competition. We need the Irish to be able to do their own thing. Otherwise business tax rates would simply rise in lockstep across Europe. We should be resisting the Commission’s approach, and we should recognise that the fault in the whole affair lies with our national arrangements – our own system for not getting a fair whack from the tech giants. After years of Labour inertia, George Osborne has made progress. The Google payback is a start. We now need to go further. We want, need and deserve these companies somehow to pay more tax in the UK. But the problem does not lie with the firms, or the Irish government, and it certainly should not need Brussels to sort it out.It is not so very long ago that Sir Jimmy Savile was thought to be a national treasure, a fund-raiser of genius, whose sheer love of humanity expressed itself in his curious willingness to work all night alone in the morgue. Cyril Smith was the genial and much loved fatso of the Liberal party, who went to his grave amid tearful tributes. Greville Janner was revered for his work with Holocaust survivors. All three of them are now alleged to have done very vile stuff. None would be let anywhere near a kindergarten. All would now be behind bars or facing prosecution.My point is that terrible things turn out to have been done by very famous, very saintly-seeming people; and as Lord Guthrie said yesterday: “High rank and public service does not disbar a man from committing heinous crimes.” The police have a duty to follow the evidence – wherever it takes them. Imagine if it turned out that they had gone soft on the field marshal, just because he was so well-connected. Imagine if it looked as though our police were conniving in some establishment conspiracy to cover up rape or child abuse.How would you feel if your children were involved? How would you feel if you were one of the victims, and no one would listen? The police have a duty to act without fear or favour. I can also understand the general reluctance – in principle – to offer an apology every time it is decided not to proceed with a case.\"You can’t blame the police, in the current climate, for taking no chances\"There will always be an evidentiary range, even in the cases that are dropped. Some cases (like Bramall’s) will end up seeming fatuous; some much less so. Sometimes the police will be so sure that they are on to something that an apology would stick in the throat. And in any case, new evidence may well turn up. They can’t apologise every time. Where do you draw the line? And why should the police apologise to Bramall, just because he is highly distinguished, and not to everyone who is the victim of some vexatious allegation?There are plenty of wholly innocent people who are maliciously accused of all kinds of things – look at the young man at Durham University who was falsely accused of rape, and whose life was put on hold, his reputation jeopardised. Why should field marshals get an apology, and not everyone else?Well, I think there is an answer to that – and it is that Lord Bramall’s very fame and distinction have helped to make things not better and easier for him, but much, much worse. If he hadn’t been Lord Bramall, the papers and websites would not have given the story so much of the publicity that aggravated his distress. And if he hadn’t been Lord Bramall, would the investigation have been conducted with quite such zeal?Let us suppose that an anonymous “victim” approached the police with a series of outlandish and unproveable   -year-old allegations against a group of blameless and excellent but otherwise obscure old codgers. Would the police have raided their houses? Would they have turned up, mob-handed, without a shred of evidence? Without a crime? Without a body? On one man’s say-so? And kept at it for months? I don’t think so.The paradox is that it is precisely because he is an establishment figure – a KG, GCB, OBE, MC, a former Lord Lieutenant – that the police feel they have to show a scrupulous refusal to be intimidated. Indeed, you could argue that this is a fine thing about our country, that no one is too grand to be ruthlessly investigated. That, today, is not much consolation to Lord Bramall. His accuser is surely sad but delusional.You can’t blame the police, in the current climate, for taking no chances. But in this case they were plainly barking up the wrong tree. I hope a way will be found of making amends, because being a British war hero didn’t help Bramall against these allegations; on the contrary, there was a sense in which his status simply made things worse. He deserves to put the last year behind him, and accept the continued thanks of his country.", "     Hey!

developers - we use Ruby and JavaScript as training languages, but the important stuff they learn are behaviours, attitudes and methodologies.Our software developers are mostly in London and Manchester, with many in other UK cities and parts of Europe and USA. However, we’re growing fast and would love to chat about your location.

It looks like you're using an old browser - here at Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cutting-edge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesn't allow us to do this. We know you can't always switch, but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.     We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we've created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.Coding is more than syntax. The best developers see themselves as Artisans.We prefer code written in pairs over code written by lone-wolves.Doing it right and going a little slower is always better than moving fast and ignoring best practise.You can read about riding a bike 'til the cows come home; unless you actually try riding one, you're unlikely to be competing in the Tour de France any time soon.It doesn't matter how much you pay a personal trainer - you still have to do the squats! As with training, so with learning.You have to be well to learn well, so we encourage our students to take care of their health - through  yoga, meditation and keeping fit.             Read more about our Manifesto                      If you're onsite           we’ve got table tennis, yoga, discussion groups, excessive N   gaming, and the odd NERF battle. These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact. Of course, there's also an enormous amount of coding. While no two days are identical, here's a general sense of what an average day might look like:         Relate what you did yesterday, what you’re planning on doing today, where you got stuck, and how you got unstuck. Lots of clapping and feel-goods.Students are introduced to key programming skills in isolation, and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting. This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff, or visualise things using a board or visualisation technology if you're a remote student.Students pair with each other either in person or remotely throughout the morning, building real stuff using tools and practices we’d expect from a professional junior developer.Our cohorts tend to lunch together. Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditch’s fine local eateries and there's often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak to!Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and keeps your brain sharp.The afternoon is spent pair programming, as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculum.A pecha kucha night, a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer, a hosted event, or a film night...we love to organise stuff to keep your social bar topped up. If you're a remote student why not game together online? Or even meet up if you're near each other.             Read more about our Coaching style           In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, all students are required to complete a (very important!) part-time PreCourse, which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy. In the first week, we focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer; second, you'll tackle version control using Git and Github. This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges. The PreCourse requires a minimum of    hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse, the better. Each Friday during the PreCourse, we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students' learning and check in on their progress.The main topics of week   are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now, students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we start creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. The Friday challenge involves writing a simple object-oriented system of interacting classes.This week we delve into more complex test-driven development and object-oriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well. We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics: lambdas vs procs, composition vs inheritance, iterators and recursion. The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core library.By now, students are comfortable using Ruby and writing object-oriented code in a test-driven way. In week   we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to Heroku.It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. Students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. Finally, students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases. This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web development.Now that students can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about other front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Students begin learning their second language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web. The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the front-end of one of the most popular websites in the world.This week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace. Working on a set project in small groups, students will learn Git workflow, QA, Standups/Scrums, Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment. This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeks.In week   we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on Rails.Students expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning a front-end JavaScript framework.This week we consolidate our learning by building a full-stack project using everything we've learnt from the previous weeks. Agile, Git workflow, User Stories, and teamwork are revisited in another team based project.By now students are confident junior developers. To put their skills to their test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final project.Early in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible. This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.This week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team. They focus on honing life-long learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market. This could include technical tests, working on open-source code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with. For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs, this is a great week to start working on your MVP!We run cohorts every   weeks onsite and every    weeks remotely, and applications are highly competitive.

We know you can't always switch, but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.     Makers Academy is a fully immersive, full-time computer programming course in London, designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into job-ready junior developers in just    weeks. We’re Europe’s #  Developer Bootcamp, running new classes of    students every   weeks in the heart of London's Tech City & every    weeks from the comfort of your own home.Being a student at Makers Academy is a very emotional journey. Eating, sleeping and breathing code becomes a huge part of your life, but looking after your wellbeing is also critical to becoming a great developer. On site we have Dana, our Chief Joy Officer - a certified yoga instructor who runs daily yoga and meditation classes and is here to look after your well being but don't worry if you're a remote student, Dana can also provide remote check ins too and send resources on how to develop your own meditation practise.It’s also important to unwind and bond socially with your cohort. We're surrounded by some of London's quirkiest cafes, yummiest street food and busiest pubs. We host regular events such as Petcha Kutcha lightning talks, games nights, karaoke nights, as well as organising group activities like climbing, go-karting and going to the theatre. Remote students are encouraged to start engaging wih their local tech community and if another Remote student is near you, we encourage you to meet up and bond!Our mission is to teach as many people as possible to create amazing products using beautiful code. Since we started in early     , we’ve grown from two people to a team of twenty. We are not just colleagues: we’re a family. The Makers Academy team is a diverse bunch who work hard and play hard.           Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs.           Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market. At the same time, Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him   months and    hours a week to get through it. A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory, they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers, and something had to be done.         About   months after that conversation they started their first cohort ‐ in February      - creating Makers Academy - an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer, allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in   hyper-intensive months in London. Before we knew it, forcing people to move to London in order to learn to code felt far too limiting, so in February      we launched Makers Academy Remote, codenamed 'Ronin': a course that leverages everything we've learned at Makers Academy to help people all over the world learn to code - from the comfort of their own home.Makers Academy has now been going for over   years and has graduated over     students.Paul Graham, the tech startup visionary behind YCombinator coined the term Maker for those individuals that truly produce. The Makers Academy mission is to give every student the skills to call themselves a Maker.Makers Academy officially runs  am to  pm, Monday to Friday at the Makers Academy studio in Shoreditch at   -   Commercial St – right at the centre of the tech startup community, a few minutes away from Shoreditch High Street station and Google Campus. We welcome anyone who wants to arrange a visit to see how we operate.Absolutely. Programming expertise takes years to master, but that's not the point of Makers Academy. We want to give you a foundation so that you can be a top candidate for an entry-level position at a world class startup or technology company. Whether you're looking to change careers or you want to start your own startup but can't find a technical co-founder, Makers Academy is for you. To learn more about the underlying research, see this essay on Why Learning to Code is So Hard.At the moment we do not have a dedicated housing department but members of our team can assist you with finding short term accommodation in London. In the past students have used sites like Gumtree, Zoopla, Spareroom.co.uk and many others to find a house. In London it's pretty easy to find a room at short notice if you put your mind to it.Indeed we do. Sign up to our mailing list to be notified when tickets go on sale.The company was formed in November     , and we ran our first course in February     .Of course. Our doors are open for anyone to come and visit. Book an appointment with one of our team here.While we don't set specific limits on how many students we accept, typically about   % of applicants end up studying at Makers Academy. We have a rigorous selection process, designed to find the most capable, driven and passionate people, and we aren't afraid to turn people away if we don't think they have what it takes to succeed at Makers Academy. It's not called \"Oxbridge meets the Marines, but for Developers\" for nothing!After submitting your online application, we'll invite you for an interview. In the interview we'll ask a few questions and do a bit of simple pair programming. You have no need to be afraid - we're not testing to see if you can already code. We're testing to see how you handle stressful situations where you're navigating the unknown. It'll be fun - we promise!In truth, there isn't a huge amount you can do to improve your chances at the interview stage - other than following the instructions we give you and studying the materials that we recommend. It's designed to find people who have natural reasoning skills, bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code. We're not testing whether you've memorised syntax - we're testing whether you can follow instructions and have the passion to learn some basic code without our support. The following articles will help you develop the sorts of behaviours and skills we look for in a candidate:Having said that, if you do already have some coding experience, even if you only went through a few introductory tutorials, this will be to your advantage. We recommend the following resources to get started as a web developer, regardless of whether you want to join Makers Academy or not:The interview is designed to test how you think, rather than what you know, but going through ‘Learn to Program’ by Chris Pine or the ‘Ruby Essentials’ course on lynda.com will put you in a great position when it comes to the pair programming part of the interview.No. All you need is passion and the ability to unlearn the word 'quit'.Absolutely. Makers Academy is more than just learning how to program — it's learning how to be a developer. It's learning how to build your own prototypes. It's learning where to go to find answers. It's learning about what the atmosphere of working in a startup is really like. It's learning to be a Maker from some of the best Makers in the world.Absolutely. We’ve had students from all over Europe, the USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand and even Venezuela.We welcome International Students. We've had people join us from France, Germany, The USA, even South Africa. The course cost is the same wherever you're from and you apply in the normal way. We are not legally able to assist or advise on visa related issues, so we would advise you to obtain the services of a professional visa organisation.It’s a bit of a cliche that coding is all about Maths (Computer Science is Maths heavy… Writing code, not so much!). In reality, anything above If/Else statements and simple AND/OR logic is done largely by the computer. It’s more important that you have the right sort of mentality, that you’re comfortable working in ‘the unknown’ and that you aren’t afraid to fail. So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths, you’ve got everything you need.There is a huge spectrum of learning difficulties, and we would never generalize to say that any learning difficulty would make our course unattainable. We've had a number of students with dyslexia do very well on the course, but please feel free to get in touch to discuss your personal requirements. While we're not experts in this field, we will do everything we can to support anyone who is serious about learning to code.We don’t track the number specifically, but we’ve had students from all over Europe, the USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and even VenezuelaMakers Academy is taught by a cadre of world-class technologists and entrepreneurs. They have founded various technology startups and have decades of educational experience between them. In addition, Makers Academy brings in world class speakers from top London technology companies.Currently we only offer our full-time course because we don't believe we could deliver a world-class result on a part-time basis - yet. One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning. The   -week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and we're not yet certain how we could deliver that with a part-time regiment…but we're working on it. Stay tuned!No. Makers Academy will provide all of the equipment needed. That being said, feel free to bring your own laptop if you'd like as long as it's a Mac or a Linux (the software you'll be using is really hard to use on Microsoft Windows).By far the best way to learn to code in such a short amount of time is to live and breathe it. You would need to attend Makers Academy from  am- pm, Monday-Friday, for the    weeks that you're studying. Bear in mind that this is a minimum requirement - the more time you give to the course the better the results will be! If you absolutely cannot make it to London, we have a new full-time online program that mirrors our off-line course.Students will be at Makers Academy from  am until  pm (although many stay well into the evening), Monday through Friday for the duration of the    week course. We use a combination of self-study, class-based instruction, hands-on exercises and pair programming to give you a well-rounded overview of how to apply each new concept.Our agile approach means we improve our course and curriculum with each cohort, but you can get a flavour of the structure from our curriculum.Yes. We have developed a part time PreCourse that needs to be completed before starting the course. We focus on the foundations: command-line, version control and the basics of Ruby. The PreCourse requires an average of   -   hours per week to complete successfully.The fact that we’ve had over     students graduate from Makers Academy, and our track record in getting students hired at companies like BSkyB, Pivotal Labs, ThoughtWorks and many other top tech companies mean that YES, it is possible to learn to code in    Weeks. Make no mistake - it will be tough. It will take hard work and dedication, but if you really want it, it’s there to be had.The course doesn’t just focus on Ruby on Rails. You'll learn a number of languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and more, but you're right in saying that you will leave Makers Academy with Ruby as your strongest language. However, we focus much of our efforts on teaching you the skills to think like a Developer (note the capital D!), and our graduates have gone on to work in a number of programming languages after leaving Makers Academy.Towards the end of the course, students work in teams on a project. Everyone is invited to pitch an \"idea\" and after a couple of rounds of voting, we construct teams based on project choice. Two weeks later the team present their projects to friends and family as part of their graduation.While you’ll get a taste of many languages while studying, we offer one course and one course only, and Ruby forms its backbone. If you’re sure that you want to learn a language like Python or C# then the course may not be for you.We do touch on Agile working methodologies and even some Lean Startup principles, but this isn’t the main focus of the course, nor is design. You will learn some basic principles in all these areas, but this is primarily a course where you will learn to code.Our Net Promoter Score (as decided by feedback from all students over the past year) is   . The highest you can get is a    , and anything above    is considered to be ‘Excellent’.Out of around     students so far we have had around    drop out, for various reasons. We have an application/interview process at Makers Academy that is designed to only accept people who are serious about learning to code, but we can’t always get it right!There’s no such thing as too old! Our students are incredibly diverse - people of all ages, backgrounds, sectors and experiences - so we don’t have a maximum age limit. The one thing that has been constant with all of our applicants is a passion for coding, and a burning determination to succeed.No. Remote students are expected to commit to  am to  pm, Monday to Friday (at a minimum, but most work well into the evening to finish their work). We also set weekend project work to keep you engaged, so if you really want to get to a professional standard in just a few months, you really have to commit to it.Yes. The value of a full-time course is huge in comparison to a part-time course. We don’t offer a part-time option because it wouldn’t produce world class developers.You don’t get a qualification when graduating Makers Academy Remote, you get a job. To be an official educational institution and to offer qualifications, we would need to submit our curriculum to the government, which would then get locked down without the possibility of any changes. Accreditation guidelines say that you have to teach the same thing for a minimum of   year before you can apply for an official qualification. Well - a year in software development is a lifetime in other industries. We update our course materials every   weeks to fit the needs of the market and the needs of our hiring partners, so we do not and will never offer official accreditation. We don't care for fancy pieces of paper - we want you to leave the course with the ability to build real projects. That's our 'qualification'.We don’t have any requirements other than a passion for coding and a commitment to learning. You don’t need any academic qualifications or work experience - just demonstrate to us that you’re keen and capable.We run a new course every    weeks, and you can take a look at all of our upcoming cohorts at the bottom of this page.The interviews for Makers Academy Remote are done remotely, to mimic the learning environment you’ll be in. We’ll also send you across some learning materials to prepare for the interview, so remember to complete all of the content to give yourself the best chance of progressing to the next stage.The PreCourse is part time and is completed remotely. You need around    hours per week (including weekends) to complete the required work. Weekly progress is compulsory on the PreCourse, to make your way onto the full-time course.Definitely! Our course is designed to turn any coding beginner into a junior developer in    weeks, and then get you a job in a world-class tech company after you graduate. Sound too good to be true? It isn’t, we do it over and over again every    weeks. If you fancy a read, you can take a look at our graduate stories hereThe majority of our hiring partners are in London, but we’ve helped graduates get jobs all over the world. As we get more Remote students, we’ll be hand-picking the top tech employers across Europe to work with us.Makers Academy Remote costs £    . We've partnered with Finance my Future, PCDL and EdAid to offer financial support. Ask about this during your interview. Hint, you need to apply first!We offer scholarships from time to time, usually in partnership with another company. By far the best way to hear about these things is by signing up to our newsletter and keeping an eye out for any new opportunities.Whilst we do have some international students join Makers Academy Remote, because of time differences do bear in mind that we don’t recommend joining the course if you are located somewhere that is more than +/-  hours GMT. Feel free to drop us an email if you want to have a chat about this in greater detail.We cover a range of content that includes languages, libraries, processes and frameworks, such as -                    Front end - HTML CSS, JavaScript                    Back end - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS                    Databases - (DataMapper, SQL) and user management                    Object Oriented Programming                    Test Driven Development & Pair Programming                    Agile, and lots more!Absolutely. We want to help in any way that we can - be that helping a student find their first (or second or third) position or just merely providing advice. We have built an extensive alumni network for all graduates. We now have a full time team to look after all post course arrangements and ensure you get a job.While it's really complicated publishing our success metrics we're committed to fully supporting you until you're happy in your new job as a developer.No. Certifications would require us to bend our curriculum to a governing body, thus reducing our agility to teach what's most relevant and to stay at the bleeding edge of what's important to the technology community. Also, the employers pay little attention to certificates but they value the skills, so we focus on the latter.On average it takes  -  months to get a job after graduation.We train you to a level of proficiency that will allow you to build your own prototypes (if you’re an entrepreneur) or to get a job as Junior Developer.The tech landscape moves fast. There are jobs available in every language - from C and Java right through Python and Ruby to Node and Clojure. With demand for Devs growing an average of   % every year, and the supply of devs flatlining at  % YoY, the reality is that if you’re a good programmer, you’ll always be in demand.We don’t offer any formal support but most of the team have extensive experience in startups and we're happy to talk to the students about their ideas.There are a number of ways you can raise funds. Check our payments page to see how previous students have done this.Unfortunately not. We will however assist with making arrangements in any way that we can – feel free to email us with any questions or requests that you may have.Due to high demand for spaces, we ask that, once accepted, students pay a non-refundable £    deposit to lock-down their spot on the course. This is to ensure that every place is taken by someone who actually intends to study at Makers Academy. Many courses end up with a waiting list and it isn't fair on waiting students for people to reserve a spot and not show up.Once a student is accepted on to the course, their spot is held for    days. In this time the seat will not be offered to anyone else. If the deposit is not paid within    days their application will be automatically archived. As the course is very selective and highly popular it will most likely mean the seat will be offered to someone else.Books are kind of outdated in the fast-paced world of software development. You won't need any on the course but we can recommend some if you're really after some physical materials.Yes - we welcome payment in Bitcoin. If you want to do so, we can talk about how to do so when you come for an interview.We offer scholarships from time to time, usually in partnership with another company.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Makers Academy community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, mental and physical ability and criminal convictions.Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities and people with criminal convictions.If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via contact@makersacademy.com. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.This code of conduct is based on the Open Code of Conduct v .  from the TODOGroup. We are thankful for their work and all the communities who have paved the way with code of conducts.

It looks like you're using an old browser - here at Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cutting-edge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesn't allow us to do this. We know you can't always switch, but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.     The following terms and conditions apply to all students accepted to study at Makers Academy (run by Makers Academy Limited (company number         ) of   -   Commercial St, London, E   LT). By applying for a Makers Academy course or paying a deposit against Makers Academy course fees you confirm acceptance of these terms and conditions as legally binding on you until successful completion by you of the course (unless terminated or cancelled earlier in accordance with these terms and conditions).Makers Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Makers Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course environment. We hope that our selection process means we will never have to do this, of course. Other than in the event of serious disruptive behavior we will seek to resolve any issues by way of coaching and dialogue before taking more serious steps.If, despite our careful selection process, we find (acting reasonably and having undertaken a thorough investigation) that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course. Provided we are satisfied, acting reasonably and taking all reasonable circumstances into consideration, that the student has made a good faith effort to succeed on the course we may choose to refund a pro-rata amount of the course fees paid by a student who is required to leave (based on the number of full weeks of the course remaining after the student was required to leave, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks) .In any other circumstances the terms of section   (“Payment of Fees if the course is not completed”) below will apply.Students will be required to comply with all rules and regulations of Makers Academy or the premises in which Makers Academy courses are held. Makers Academy reserves the right to exclude any student for failure to do so.Each Makers Academy course will last for    calendar weeks (Monday-Friday, including bank holidays), and Makers Academy may stipulate that up to one calendar day during that period is reserved for student self-study rather than tuition. In addition, Makers Academy courses will evolve. The content, structure and methods used in each course is subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the course that you attend may not be identical to previous courses, and, whilst it will be materially the same, may not be identical to that described on the Makers Academy website.Anyone accepted on a Makers Academy course is required to pay a non-refundable £    deposit to secure their place on the course, which will be deducted from the total course fees owed. Makers Academy operates a “first come first served” policy so once you have paid your deposit we will reserve a place for you on our next available course (subject to your payment of the course fees as described below).Following payment of the deposit, the student must pay    % of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Makers Academy’s bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of the course. The fee is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the ten days prior to the start of the course.If payment in full is not received by Makers Academy in its bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of a course Makers Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid his/her deposit.Makers Academy will direct students to the payment services provider used by Makers Academy so that the student can pay the deposit and course fees online. Alternatively, students can pay the deposit and course fees by bank transfer to Makers Academy’s nominated bank account.Third party providers may, from time to time, offer loans to prospective Makers Academy students. These providers are entirely independent of Makers Academy and Makers Academy assumes no responsibility or liability for the loans or services that they offer. In particular, students must undertake their own due diligence on each provider and the terms of any loans or services that they offer.If a student fails to complete a course, Makers Academy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge the student the full amount of fees outstanding (being the full course fee less the deposit paid) immediately following confirmation that the student will not be completing the course for any reason.  In exceptional circumstances Makers Academy may, in its sole discretion, agree to waive payment of part or all of the outstanding fees.Any deposit or course fee paid by a student in accordance with the payment plan selected by the student set out in section   above is non-refundable unless the course on which the student is enrolled is cancelled (whether prior to the course commencing, or after its commencement) by Makers Academy, in which case any course fee which has been paid by the student will be refunded in full.  If a course is temporarily suspended for a period of less than one month no course fees will be refunded. If a course is suspended for a period of longer than one month students enrolled on that course will be given the option of continuing the course when it resumes or receiving a pro-rata refund of course fees for the suspended part of the course (based on the number of full weeks of the course that were suspended, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks).Makers Academy may, at its discretion, require students to complete a PreCourse prior to the start of the full course for which course fees are payable. This PreCourse will be provided at no additional cost to students and is intended to ensure that each student is suitable to participate in the full course. It is envisaged that each PreCourse will last for    hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the relevant full course. If a student fails to complete the PreCourse, or Makers Academy reasonably determines that the student is not suitable to participate in the full course (including if he/she does not pass any final technical test set by Makers Academy), the student shall not be permitted to participate in the full course (and shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid).           All students must have the right to study in the UK under applicable UK rules, and hold a current visa if necessary. A guide to these rules can be found at:           http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/         As a general rule you will not need a visa if you hold a passport issued by the UK or any other country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.Please note that Makers Academy is not currently an accredited institution for the purposes of the “student visitor” category.Students will be required to produce an EEA or Swiss passport on enrolment on a course.  If you intend to rely on other documents you should provide full details to Makers Academy when applying for a course.If for any reason Makers Academy cancels a planned course after a student has been accepted on the course Makers Academy will refund to the student any deposit and course fees paid by the student (as per section  ) but will have no further liability to the student.Except in respect of death or personal injury caused by Makers Academy's negligence or Makers Academy’s fraud, Makers Academy shall not be liable (to the extent able to be excluded at law) to any student by reason of any representation (unless fraudulent), or any implied warranty, condition or other term, or any duty at common law, or under the express terms of the contract for any loss of profit or any indirect, special or consequential loss, damage, costs, expenses or other claims (whether caused by the negligence of Makers Academy, its servants or agents or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the provision of the Makers Academy course and the entire liability of Makers Academy under or in connection with the course shall not exceed the amount of Makers Academy's charges for the course on which the student is or has applied to be enrolled.Makers Academy shall not be liable to the student or be deemed in breach of contract by reason of any delay or failure to perform any of Makers Academy's obligations in relation to the course if this was due to any cause beyond Makers Academy's reasonable control.For the purposes of these terms and conditions:“Intellectual Property Rights” means patents, rights in inventions, registered and unregistered trade marks and service marks, domain names, registered designs and design rights, copyright (including such rights in computer software and databases), database rights and rights in confidential information including know how and trade secrets  (in each case for the full period thereof and extensions, revivals and renewals thereof), applications for the foregoing and the right to apply for any of the foregoing anywhere in the world, and all similar rights anywhere in the world including those subsisting in inventions, designs, drawings and computer programs; and“Student Content” means any text, files, images, photos, videos or works of authorship that you submit to us during a course, (but shall not include any content, materials or information that you have downloaded, copied or otherwise obtained from us, which you hereby acknowledge is owned by us or our licensors).We do not claim any ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights in your Student Content.

I was a cancer biologist - doing research for Cancer Research UKI've always been interested in computers. In biology, the outcomes are always so vague and open to different interpretation. I was yearning for a craft that was clear cut, and a career allowed me to be creative. In software, the code either works or it doesn't - that sort of certainty, the immediacy of running code - that was a big pull for me.I was researching coding bootcamps in London, and aside from being situated right in the heart of Tech City, I was really attracted by the long list of hiring partners that Makers Academy have built. After reading a bunch of student blogs, being inspired by all the awesome careers their grads were starting, I decided - if they could do it, why shouldn't I?The hardest parts of my Makers Academy experience came in the group work - you're thrown into a class with so many different people, getting to work with a wide variety of personalities, with different rhythms, working styles, learning speeds… My challenge was maintaining harmony with those I didn't immediately vibe with - which is no small feat when you're pairing   / !I applied for   companies that pitched at the careers fair, and I independently to a few companies too. Both hiring partners from the careers fair made me an offer a few weeks after graduation, but so too did my first choice, who I obviously accepted! It was about   weeks from graduation to signing my contract :)In general, I'm really excited by what life has in store for me. I've got my dream job now, which I start on Monday, and I can't wait! I've got a job at the company I always wanted to work for, I'm excited about the future of technology, and I'm especially excited that I get to be part of creating that future. Life's never been so exciting.Just do it!Well, the salary you can get after graduation makes it totally worthwhile. It pays for itself in a year or two, so if you're serious about changing your career, the investment is worth every penny.Before I started, my biggest fear was the idea of pairing   / . The thoughts of having to spend all day every day talking to people was intimidating. I quickly realised that, in fact, pairing is just   people working together with the same aims - to make the code work and learn as much as possible. It forced me out of my comfort zone, and noticeably improved my communication. In the end it, it turned out to be one of the best parts of my experience.The best thing I've ever done. Best decision I ever made! I made friends in my cohort that will be friends for life.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I was working in education as an administratorI was interested in development in EdTech and I was looking for a new challenge.I was looking for evening classes in coding and saw Makers Academy, then the idea stuck. I read a lot of blogs from previous students and saw other people had come from other backgrounds, turned their life around. Seeing how other people had done it made me want to join.The pace of the course was really hard to keep up with. I came with   knowledge of tech or any relevant industry so it was a bit harder for me. The PreCourse was hard - I hate Chris Pine with a passion. You always face the weekend challenges at the start of the weekend thinking \"Crap!\" but I surprised myself with how much I was able to do.I started applying for jobs straight away and going to loads of meetups. I coached at Codebar and Rails Girls and found I was able to help people. I was able to remember what it was like not knowing much and relate to the people learning. It took around   -   weeks to get a job through the careers. I applied for a few jobs on my own and the companies didn't know what to expect. I generally found the first stages of interviews quite easy and interesting. Most companies I approached myself didn't know what Makers was. One or two were okay - a few were a complete disaster. I finally got a job at MoJ with the help of the careers team.Completely. It's so different from working in admin / education. I'm able to keep learning constantly. I'm happier to have a new challenge and excited to start a new job. I'm involved in Women Hack for Non-Profits so I'm learning Python and Django.If you've done the research and got the instinct to go for it - just do it.It is! So definitely do your research. Talk to previous students and work out a budget. I tried to get used to living on a little less and being a bit more frugal.Whether I'd be able to keep up and getting a job. I think it was amazing. you spend the entire    weeks trying to keep up and worrying. You just got to hang in there and Makers always said everyone who wants a job will get one and that proved to be true.Amazing, fun & not for the faint hearted.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

Before Makers Academy I was an analyst for a bank.Someone came into my work and they automated a lot of stuff using VBA and it blew my mind. At that point I thought my job was under threat, if someone can come along and do that then it wouldn't take long until it was expected for me to have that skill. I was worried that I was going to be out of a job without that skill.It came up on Facebook and at the time I was learning VBA. I was learning it on my own: I had no one to give me guidance. I knew the code I was writing was a bit sloppy, so I thought I'd want more formal training – but not to the extent of going to university. From what I've read about Computer Science at university it doesn't prepare you as well for getting an actual job.I found pairing every day tricky. It's stressful. I think one of the most difficult things is to figure out that you are not going to learn everything. You need to learn to be patient and trust that you will eventually understand.After graduation I went travelling for   weeks. When I came back I was furiously job searching. I got an interview at Springer, which I put all my energy into preparing for as I knew it was a good company. It paid off as I got a job there!I now know I have a huge interest in coding. I'm still doing it in my free time even without someone telling me to do it.You have to commit to it! You have to be patient with the fact that it's not going to pay off straight away and you might not get a job straight away, so make sure you have some savings to keep you going.Would I be completely be able to change career within four months of doing a course? It's paid off, so it comes down to putting all the effort in.It has changed the direction of my career. Everyone at Makers has been really helpful, especially on the Ronin side of things. it's defo been good value for money.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

Worked as a German customer support representative.I've always had an interest in making websites. I've took some online courses on coursera which focussed on HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript & jQuery. I really enjoyed that and then joined a women who code event, spoke to some women who had done a bootcamp and were now really happy. So I did some research and joined Makers!Knew someone who worked with a Maker and that made me look into it. Went to a tester event in November which confirmed my decision.The change from a  -  job to back to school was quite a change. Also pairing every day took some time to get used to but I do love it now and know how beneficial it is.I've found a job through my personal network quite quickly. Really enjoyed hiring week and it helped me a lot to realise what I want and how I am!Super excited to start my new career!Definitely do it! Do some research before - there are loads of online courses to see if you like it enough to change careers. I also recommend the Makers taster weekend to get a feel for this place.It's less time and money than a university degree and you learn everything you need to start a career really quickly!Finding a job afterwards and that I wouldn't be able keep up during the course. I have found a job and I have built about   projects per week which gave me confidence that I can code.So much fun! Learnt so much in such a short amount.

They couldn't be missed!Anything Javascript! I especially struggled with the Node & Angular weeks!After graduation I spent   weeks coding & doing interviews/tech-tests before being offered a job!I think I may have learnt just as much as I did when on the course, as Makers lets you prove to yourself you can learn any language you want! I had to learn Python & Django in   week for a job interview, something I would never have had the courage to do that without what I learnt Makers.Try writing some code, maybe book on a taster day & if it's something you enjoy just take the plunge!I would say, yes it is but if you're willing to work hard it's more than possible to get a great job with a great salary which will outweigh the cost.My worry was that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the intensity of the course & that I might not be able to understand some of the basic concepts however this was soon put to ease.

It made me deal with lots of different technologies and it was interesting as well as difficult. It was great to get to know the juniors a bit better – and not having to leave!I'd say \"do it\"! Do some coding and online code courses to check if you like and enjoy coding. It's definitely the best thing I've ever done – if anything I wish I hadn't waited. Prepare first - make sure you're in a position to afford to do it as you don't want to waste any time while you are here.I think it is real value for money. It sets you up for a career change, that is a huge-value item. To go from receptionist to developer in   months! If anything the course being short is a good thing as you pack so much in.My biggest fear was that I would not be any good at coding. I think that's what everyone is frightened of! At the end of the day, practice is major point of coding. It's like writing: keep at it and you'll get there. Also, don't expect yourself to be a computer prodigy! You see Mr Robot and you'll be like \"I'll never be that good\", but no one needs to be that good. There is a lot of code that needs to be written, so there is room for everybody.Postive, amazing and life-changing. I've made loads of friends and I think they are friends for life – and I've learned a whole new trade.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

Before Makers Academy I studied psychology, and then I was working on science research.I went to San Francisco! I was dissatisfied with my current job as the culture was too conservative. I was sitting in a Bar in San Fran with some friends and they suggested I do a bootcamp, which led me to research bootcamps and end up here.It was quite random. I wasn't based in the UK. I was looking at bootcamps in the EU and came across Makers, and decided to apply here.I started applying to jobs in lab week and I started going to interviews. I went to a bunch of interviews. Everything from bigger companies to tiny companies. Ultimately I decided I wanted to work for ThoughtWorks as that was my first choice: then I really committed to that application process.It's nice to be able to sleep in! I was quite hard on myself in terms of job hunting. It's nice to be able to have some downtime now.Spend a bunch of time and figure out if coding is for you. Build something to help you figure that out!I have a well-paid job so it's been a good bargain. It can definitely be worth it; you can't just go for the ride, you need to be very active in learning and so on. There is a lot of opportunity for people like us, but you have to reach for it and not expect it to land in your lap.My biggest fear was that I would not get a job fast enough, hence I was very aggressive. I'm happy as I succeeded.Very intense and immersive.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I had been running a geomatics consultancy I setup a couple of years previous and I was looking to integrate more web / cloud / IoT techniques and deliverables in our portfolio and into our processes in general.Being in an industry constantly dealing with data, I had always had an interest in coding as a way to not be constrained by the software I was using and being able to solve the problems I was working on. Initially it was playing around with scripts in GIS software and their connected databases and then writing standalone programs for specific tasks. I loved the idea of web based technologies but had no idea where to start as it was much wider and more daunting than what I had tackled before.I attended a charity weekend hosted by MA for Tech Bikers and found out about MA then. The team were awesome and decided to try and find a way to do it around running my company. The first Remote cohort was advertised and this seemed like an ideal opportunity that was more feasible to me than re-locating to London at the time.Remembering to lift my head up and pickup the big picture once in a while, rather than focusing on the macro concepts of the day and hence not understanding how concepts fitted together. I didn’t do this often enough, the learning outcomes introduced later in the course helped me towards identifying this. I now find it very useful in accelerating my progression.It became even busier! I re-joined the business and spent a few weeks doing all the company stuff that I had put off during Makers. At the same time I was keen to start using my new skills. We were just going into trialling a new virtual environment technology for geo-data communication, so I was able to set about an agile process to prototype a cloud delivery method that we now use in production, it was a real boost to have a real world project that was returning revenue in such a short period of time and one that combined my skills in the geomatics industry with my new coding skill set.I absolutely love the fact that I am now able to take ideas we have as a company and act fast on iterating these to prototype and potentially onto deliverable / product / tool. I've always had the sticking point before of being able to conceptualise the idea, but then struggle to know where to start on implementing it. The focus on Agile Methodologies at Makers along with the coding and the focus on Software Craftsmanship means I have some confidence that while junior at this I am building self documenting, maintainable codebases. It means I can bring outside developers in for senior support/guidance and eventually grow the team in-house without having to set about projects again from the start.Ensure you enjoy coding, try it out - there are plenty of online resources & hopefully you’ll find a passion for problem solving. Then commit    % to it. It’s an intense environment and you will need all your energy, effort and focus to get the most out of it.Look at what other training you can get for £    , commercially it’s very little (I quite easily, in my industry, spend £   -£    for technical training for employees per day), in terms of University £     doesn’t go far. Also why not investigate Remote for a lower cost option which is half the price!I was worried that stepping away from my business for   months would not be sustainable. It turns out that with the right planning and support it was probably one of the best things to do, as it gave me a new perspective and expanded the potential of the business.Intensive, Challenging and Highly ProductiveDeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I was working in digital marketing mainly for tech startups.As part of my marketing work I did a bit of front end stuff like HTML and CSS and that was the stuff I enjoyed the most so I wanted to do that full time. I also kept looking over enviously at the development team as that's what I really wanted to be doing.I came across Makers Academy when I started researching online for courses and it seemed like the best route to switch careers. I also came in to one of the graduation days which really convinced me after seeing the projects on show on what could be learned in    weeks.Constantly learning new things was the biggest challenge and learning not to do everything straight away.I met the head of engineering and head of products at the careers fair and of the back of that I applied for the role they had at offer and went through the interview process with them and was hired   weeks after graduating. Throughout that time I kept coming to Makers Academy to stay in the loop and work on side projects.The main thing is that for me that the work and life border lines have been blurred. I no longer dread monday mornings and look forward to work!Definitely do it!I looked at a lot of different routes into switching careers into becoming a developer and I found that Makers Academy good value in comparison to things like masters which take longer. Also Makers is more of a direct route into a natural job and for that it's worth the time and money.My biggest fear was falling behind compared to other people who had done more coding and not being able to get a job after but I was proved wrong!Challenging but overall really fun!DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I was working as bartender in London.I felt like that what I was doing wasn't enough and I needed something more challenging so I knew from university that I liked code and I figured my level of english was good enough to join a bootcamp here.I was looking for bootcamps in London and I did some research and I ended up liking Makers Academy because I spoke to people who did the course and they told me that the environment here is like a family and was enjoyable.There is a lot going on in a short amount of time and it's hard to try and understand everything. It was a lot of information and it is good that they push you.Thoughtworks was the first company I applied to but I had to wait for the recruiter to come back and I actually turned down offers from other companies because I felt Thoughtworks was a good company for me to grow in.Don't be scared and that everything is possible and it's all about your willpower to make a change. If someone says you need a degree to do it - it isn't true.When you spend money on your education and future, it always works out as you are learning something.My personal fear was that due to being in England for only a year my level of english is very basic and I was worried that I'd struggle to learn in English but I did fine and got job.It was an experience that I'll remember all my life.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I was working as a project and programme manager in the commercial department of the Open University.I had been working a lot with technology and edtech products and I was seeing how technology is changing the educational industry, so I was reading alot about how learning to code was the thing everyone was doing. I started learning to code online and I did a week long front end course and loved it and realised it was something I wanted to be doing full-timeI started to do some research and Makers Academy stood out as the best option.The pace of the course and the number of new concepts. Everytime it feels like you have handle on something you got to move onto something new. It feels like you are wailing through quicksand trying to get your head around this mad stuff.I mainly went through the careers team at Makers to apply to opportunities. It moved very quickly. The Wednesday of hiring week we visited another company. We had to learn Java in   days and did more tech tests and interviews. I got an offer from there but I was working on Thoughtworks tech test and was waiting on that so I ended up rejecting my first offer while waiting for ThoughtWorks to come through as I really wanted that.My life has changed completely. I feel so much more connected to technology and the digital evolution as I can understand things in depht. I feel like I can make a change in peoples lives now as well as I've started to volunteer at Codebar as a coach and I've got a job as a Junior Software Developer so it's all so amazing!Spend time working out if it's right for you and is it something you will love doing. If you love learning new things then chances are you will love it so go for it. It's scary but the rewards outway the risks.You would be hard pushed to find any other course that is good value money. If you look it's less than a price of a year at university and is more vocational and more job ready and even if you are not going in as developer. It's still a very useful skill to have and be able to understand and connect with them on a different kind of level.I was most scared of not being able to do it as I'm not technical nor do I come from a maths background. It was hard but aslong as I spent time working at it, I found it to be possible so that when I came across things that were difficult that I knew I would be able to understand them given enough time.It's changed the way I see the world and how I approach problems! I definitely feel empowered.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I've started to volunteer in teaching people how to code, teaching people who were in the same place I was a year ago which is very cool.Think it through carefully and talk to as many people as you can because every persons experience it is different.  It's a big financial and time commitment but it was worth it for me.It is a lot of money but you pay for more than just the curriculum. You learn best practices like TDD and pairing, you learn how to think about code right and how to learn things well and fast and you build a strong relationships with the Makers community.My first fear that I was worried I wasn't going to be good enough and now I feel that coding is about mindset and once you have the right mindset it is very easy to pick up.

I'm now in an industry that really excites me.As long as you can commit and know that you are passionate then it's definitely worth it. It will make you a lot happier.It is a big investment but the skills you get are priceless. It opens you up to a lot of opportunities. If you are willing to make a change it's not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things and it's cheaper than university.My fear was that I wouldn't enjoy the course and that my investment would go to waste but it didn't.Lifechanging and given me a brand new family of enthusiastic and fun people.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I don't see anything as scary anymore and I see it as an opportunity to learn.It may seem like you are about to jump of a cliff but that's the whole point. Sometimes you need to shake everything up in your life.In your head you might be like I can do this on my own in my bedroom as there are so many free resources but coding is hard. You need to be pushed and be held accountable. There is nothing more motivating than paying £ k on something. It's an investment.I remember my dad saying that I'll never get a job doing that. It didn't bother me because my dad doesn't know anything about technology but at the same time it did play on my mind that will this all be for nothing but it was a stupid fear as I did get a job in the end.

I was a working as a financial analyst at Amazon.There were two things that made me want to learn to code. Firstly, the opportunity - because there's a lot of demand for developers. The other was my experiences from when I was at Amazon. I got to see developers get to do very cool stuff and I wanted to be part of it.First time I heard about Makers Academy was through the Financial Times. Then the second thing was a friend of a friends sister did Makers Academy and she gave it a good review. The personal endorsement helped in making a decision.I took   weeks off to go and code on my own and learn Clojure and went to lots of meetups and got to know the developer community. I was also an Alumni helper too. I then started to apply to jobs and within   weeks I had   offers!Have a stab at trying to learn to code yourself and if you really enjoy it then take the plunge.Makers Academy is half of the price of a masters but takes a third/quarter of the time to do and Makers Academy also takes a vested interest in finding you a job.Awesome!DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I worked as a business analyst at Eastjet.I wanted to make things and digital products.I came to one of the taster weekends to try it out. I decided to apply as I wanted to change career and make my hobby my work.I found the weekend challenges difficult because the later ones got more difficult.It was quite difficult as I was used to getting headhunted and I was used to going to interviews. This time however it was difficult because the recruiters could not help as they had no idea how to help with junior development jobs so it came down to just applying directly. In the past I've never been nervous but as this was something new I also got nervous at interviews.It has changed a bit. I feel empowered that I now have the skills to build websites and mobile apps.Do it! It's definitely do-able and regardless of when and why and what for. Realise you have to work hard and realise it's defo worth it.It is definitely worth it. It gives you space and break from what you were doing before. You are in a new environment with different people focussed on coding.The main fear I had was not being able to learn how to code and those fears never go away but after having gone through MA and getting through it, that gives you confidence to take the next challenges.Enjoyable in the professional and social level.

I was an architect.I was volunteering with an NGO in India using technology to map slums. The experience planted the seed for leveraging the power of code to solve everyday problems.Getting used to failing and continue trying anyways, managing my own expectations, writing my first blog (and winning the blog competition), the emotional stress of making such a big transition and constant brain exhaustion.I travelled to South America and visited my family in Vancouver while I continued to code / job hunt and interview remotely, all thanks to the awesome Makers Academy careers team who are truly agile and supportive in any way possible.TES Global - working on a digital platform to help teachers source their teaching materials / build a community.I am still the same person but my outlook to life and my own capacity as a human being has changed.You owe it to yourself to do something about it - life is too short.£     vs a life changing opportunity?My biggest worry was whether or not I was too old to dive in to something so different, whether or not I could catch up, or that coding is right for me having being in architecture for a decade.

I was working as an account executive at a medical communication agency.I got envious of the developers I worked with and decided I wanted to learn to code and have a fun job.I googled computer science degrees to begin with and Makers Academy came up which introduced me to coding bootcamps. I read a couple of testimonials and spoke to alumni which lead me to take the plunge.I went travelling for   months after the course and once I was back I started to work on my pet projects. While continuing to learn I started to look for a job and got one at QA Works.What I found difficult was having the mental resilience to persevere through the course.

I was an English and Maths tutor.Two things, I wanted a more intellectually challenging and rewarding career and my best friend who is a front-end developer had told me for years I should try programming. I eventually listened!I felt I had two options, a CS Masters degree for career-changers or a development bootcamp. After I researched and saw a lot of recommendations on switchup.org, student blogs, and on the Makers website, I went with Makers. For me it was clearly the most intense and the most thorough.I found it difficult to balance my desire to know everything immediately with my sanity! There is so much to learn!I spent the first   weeks after I graduated as an alumni helper and then really focused on the job hunt. I applied and applied and accepted a job as a junior software developer at Surfdome.Do a lot of research and figure out the expectation of how long it will take to get a new job and make sure you have enough money to last. Changing careers has been the best thing to happen to me. It takes work but is incredibly rewarding.Judge for yourself if it's worth it. You normally get a starting salary of around £  k for a Junior Developer.

I was a journalist and editor for   + years working on a variety of publications, covering politics and finance among other topics.Journalism is being transformed by web technologies and I found myself increasingly interested in the technical side of things rather than providing content. Also after    years in the trade I felt it was time for a new challenge.I heard about Makers Academy through a friend of mine who was involved in the Shoreditch tech industry a few years ago. It seemed ideal in terms of the curriculum and geared towards people with unusual backgrounds looking to change career.The second half was the hardest, grappling with frameworks like Rails and Angular. That part of the course was a bit hectic I thought, and I often felt a bit at sea. I think I'm instinctively more of a pure coder than a framework user, if that distinction makes sense. I'm sure it was the other way round for many others on the course though!I hit the Christmas lull shortly after graduating so it was pretty slow. Spent a couple of months doing tech tests and applications. All the applications I made were via Makers. Accepted an offer at PensionBee in February and started there last week.It's busy! Been a while since I've had a fulltime  -  office job (as opposed to freelancing or doing shifts). Am thoroughly enjoying it though.Do it! You won't regret it. Coding is a lot easier than people think it is and it's a profession with a future where your skills will always be in demand (the same alas is no longer true of journalism).You'll make the money back pretty quickly when you start work. Get a Careers Development Loan if you can. Though it would be good if Makers Academy offered more bursaries.That I wouldn't \"fit in\" in tech culture and that my unusual career background would count against me when jobhunting. But it turns out the tech industry is full of oddballs with unusual backgrounds, so this worry was more about my own private hang-ups than being based in anything objective.Exhilarating, intense, stimulating.DeliveryCurriculumPair ProgrammingCoach-led WorkshopsTalks by Industry LeadersMeditation, Yoga, 'Joy' activitiesCareers Fair @MA HQ, LondonHiring SupportDepositWomens DiscountFull Time, Offline, in LondonChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyFace-to-FaceLive, in PersonLive, in PersonCertified Yoga Instructor On SiteHiring Week + Intro to Hiring Partners£   £   Full Time, Remote, GlobalChallenge-Based, by Makers AcademyRemote via VoIPLive, OnlineSome Streamed (Speaker-Dependent)Your Own Practice, at HomeIn Major Tech Hubs Only£                        Makers Academy                       -   Commercial St                                          London                     E   LT                                          United Kingdom                                                     © Makers Academy                ", "     Hey!

I had been working as a Country Manager in online marketing for mobile telecom and online betting companies.I had been doing short courses in the past, but that was never enough to get into a proper coding job. I wanted something more creative - building prototypes, less business meetings, actionable approaches to actually building stuff from scratchI came across Makers Academy through Google and I have been to a couple of graduation days to get the sense of the experience students were going through.After graduation I decided to spend two months reviewing material and focusing more on front-end and JavaScript. I applied for jobs and the first  one I got was as a Web Analyst. It proved not to be exactly what I expected, so kept searching until I landed a job as Junior UI Developer for Immediate Media, a big online publishing company.The Makers Academy experience gave me a lot of confidence that I can learn quickly and changed the way I learn into a healthy dose of experimenting and breaking things. I also adopted a mentality of not being afraid to make mistakes constantly, which is the only way to learn. Finally, I got an interesting job, great career prospects and an extremely stimulating work environment and people.Trust your gut feeling, play with Codecademy's simple tutorials to see if writing code gives you actual buzz.It is expensive but this is less than what you would pay for a year of studies which won’t get you a job. This is an investment, a way to get into an exciting and booming industry where your skills will be hugely in demand, and not only in the UK. As a mental exercise, you can divide the sum by the months, number of weeks and days you will be sitting for   hours coding with fellow Makers, if you do your maths you will see that the hourly price is actually a bargain.Very hard work but life changing experience. Some of us were miserable, but kept going and pushing ourselves. Keep positive and never feel bad about not knowing something, try to explore as much as you can.
