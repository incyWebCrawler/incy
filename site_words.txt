stuff they learn are behaviours attitudes and methodologiesOur software developers are mostly in London and Manchester with many in other UK cities and parts of Europe and USA However were growing

Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cuttingedge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesnt allow us to do this We know you cant always switch but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome     We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum weve created We currently use a mixture of workshops exercises projects classroom breakout sessions and endofweek challenges to help our students understand programming The immersive environment having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational processCoding is more than syntax The best developers see themselves as ArtisansWe prefer code written in pairs over code written by lonewolvesDoing it right and going a little slower is always better than moving fast and ignoring best practiseYou can read about riding a bike til the cows come home unless you actually try riding one youre unlikely to be competing in the Tour de France any time soonIt doesnt matter how much you pay a personal trainer  you still have to do the squats As with training so with learningYou have to be well to learn well so we encourage our students to take care of their health  through  yoga meditation and keeping fit             Read more about our Manifesto                      If youre onsite           weve got table tennis yoga discussion groups excessive N   gaming and the odd NERF battle These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact Of course theres also an enormous amount of coding While no two days are identical heres a general sense of what an average day might look like         Relate what you did yesterday what youre planning on doing today where you got stuck and how you got unstuck Lots of clapping and feelgoodsStudents are introduced to key programming skills in isolation and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff or visualise things using a board or visualisation technology if youre a remote studentStudents pair with each other either in person or remotely throughout the morning building real stuff using tools and practices wed expect from a professional junior developerOur cohorts tend to lunch together Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditchs fine local eateries and theres often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak toProgramming is extremely challenging Meditation helps keep a lid on things keeps you grounded and keeps your brain sharpThe afternoon is spent pair programming as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculumA pecha kucha night a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer a hosted event or a film nightwe love to organise stuff to keep your social bar topped up If youre a remote student why not game together online Or even meet up if youre near each other             Read more about our Coaching style           In the four weeks preceding the fulltime course all students are required to complete a very important parttime PreCourse which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy In the first week we focus on the foundations first the commandline which is key to navigating around your computer second youll tackle version control using Git and Github This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges The PreCourse requires a minimum of    hours per week to complete successfully but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse the better Each Friday during the PreCourse we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students learning and check in on their progressThe main topics of week   are testdriven development and objectoriented programming By now students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes This week we start creating our own classes in a testdriven way The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects The Friday challenge involves writing a simple objectoriented system of interacting classesThis week we delve into more complex testdriven development and objectoriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics lambdas vs procs composition vs inheritance iterators and recursion The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core libraryBy now students are comfortable using Ruby and writing objectoriented code in a testdriven way In week   we focus on the fundamentals of the web HTTP protocols the Sinatra framework HTML  CSS We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to HerokuIts time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper In this week we talk about relational databases keyvalue stores and SQL We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts hashing and salting choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks Students write a user management system sign up sign in sign out etc from scratch paying special attention to the security aspects Finally students also learn how to use Capybara to testdrive web applications The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web developmentNow that students can build testdriven secure databasebacked web applications its time to start talking about other frontend technologies JavaScript jQuery AJAX and responsive design Students begin learning their second language JavaScript also known as the language of the web The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the frontend of one of the most popular websites in the worldThis week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace Working on a set project in small groups students will learn Git workflow QA StandupsScrums Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeksIn week   we start working with Ruby on Rails By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby the web HTTP HTML JavaScript etc and have experience using databases Armed with all this knowledge they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it This week we talk about ActiveRecord the asset pipeline routing and Rails architecture The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on RailsStudents expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning a frontend JavaScript frameworkThis week we consolidate our learning by building a fullstack project using everything weve learnt from the previous weeks Agile Git workflow User Stories and teamwork are revisited in another team based projectBy now students are confident junior developers To put their skills to their test they build a final project that shows how far theyve come since they started This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final projectEarly in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code There is no Friday challenge Instead we have a graduation ceremony followed by a party attended by friends families hiring partners recruiters exstudents and prospective students of Makers AcademyThis week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team They focus on honing lifelong learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market This could include technical tests working on opensource code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs this is a great week to start working on your

Learn more about whats changed                 The event for people building the future of software September      in SanFrancisco LearnmoreThe open source Git project has just released Git      with features and bugfixes from over    contributors Heres our look at some of the most interesting new featuresWhen you run git push youve probably seen a progress meter telling you how many objects youve sent how many are left and how fast the data is moving But what happens after all of the data has made it to the server Are we doneNot quite Even though the receiver of a push does as much work as possible while the data is flowing in there are a few CPUintensive tasks it cant start until the whole thing has arrived And while thats happening Git is completely silent Most pushes are small enough that this phase finishes quickly and you never notice But when pushing a large number of objects this can take many seconds or even minutes leaving you to wonder if things are still workingWorse because the network connection is completely silent during this phase you run the risk of the connection being dropped by HTTP proxies or other network infrastructure Thats an easy way to turn your wondering into frustrationGit     adds progress reports for these postreceive operations to keep you entertained and to make sure the network knows were still goingOf course youre not always around to watch those progress meters For pushes without a terminal or run with quiet Git     also sends periodic keepalive packets to keep the network connection runningThe progress reporting and keepalives are all implemented on the server side of the connection and are backwardscompatible with all existing versions of Git So you dont even need to upgrade to see them but your hosting provider doesA few other progressrelated improvements came along for the ride too  git clone now gives an accurate progress meter when checking that it received all of the necessary objects And some progress messages like those from an autogc of the remote repository are more clearly marked as coming from the remotesource sourceGPGsigned tags and commits have been a part of Git for a long time but the workflows and tooling around them are still not that convenient to use Git     takes a few incremental steps in this area Along with some behindthescenes robustness improvements it adds a new configuration option logshowSignature to verify signatures for every invocation of git logThe default output format for signature verification has also been changed to show   bit GPG keyids even when using older versions of GPG   bit ids are already the default on newer versions This is in response to the Evil    project which showed how easy it is to generate fake keys which collide in the   bit keyid space That project is two years old but got new attention recently as somebody uploaded all of the fake keys from their dataset to the public keyserversIf youre not yet signing your commits and tags there are several guides to help you get startedsource source sourceYouve probably seen that Git can produce colorful output in your terminal  But did you know that those colors are configurable or that you can use them in custom log formats and prompts Some people get pretty fancyGit     comes with a few new options its color code now understands italic and strikethrough attributesIn addition the Cauto placeholder has been fixed which is handy if you are designing custom log output color support now works out of the box on FreeBSD and the default colors for HEAD decorations have been tweaked to increase visibilitysource source source sourceYou shouldnt ever need to debug your HTTP connections but if you do Git     supports the GIT_TRACE_CURL environment variable It supersedes the old GIT_CURL_VERBOSE variable and gives more details supports redirecting to a file to avoid tangling with the rest of Gits output and most importantly will automatically scrub your authentication information from the result making it safe to share the output with a fellow debugger  sourceThe smarthttp protocol will now grow its negotiation windows more aggressively which should result in fewer roundtrips when fetching a large repository over HTTP sourcesubmodule update and clone recursive have learned to retry a single cloning failure for each submodule to make ephemeral server and network failures less annoying  sourceManpages in the terminal will now have literal phrases shown in bold these are generally shown in a fixedspace typewriter font in the HTML pages but were not decorated at all in the terminal sourceGits internal dateformatting code can now correctly show dates past the year      Phew fixed with only    years to spare sourceSimilarly git archive can now generate tarfiles with POSIX extensions to handle files larger than  GB and timestamps later than the year        gigaseconds since      sourceThats just a sampling of the changes in Git     which contains over     commits Check out the the full release notes for the complete listOlivia Ross is a high school sophomore at Phillips Exeter Academy After teaching herself to code in junior high she found herself addicted to this new medium for her creativity Now a game designer shes taken her coding skills and blended them with the humanities As she explores the rapidly emerging field of interactive media arts she volunteers as a technical instructor at Black Girls CODE events in NYC to help girls of color find that same creative energy within themselves and become the leaders of tomorrowShe shared her thoughts with us on the mission of Black Girls CODE the future of game design and some advice for young women trying to break into techHow did you first discover you were interested in technologyI was first interested in tech during spring break in sixth grade My brother was in college and he came home with a book about HTML and CSS He was not particularly interested in it and he tossed it aside somewhere I found it and I was kind of fascinated by it After he took the book back to school I tried to do some research online about web development and accidentally clicked View Source I honestly thought Id broken the browser However after googling the first line of the source code which happened to just be  header  tags I realized that was what HTML looked like I realized I never wanted to be confused about technology again I wanted to understand everything about how it worked Needless to say I became a very proficient Googler How did you become involved with Black Girls Code and what was the experience likeThe summer before sixth grade I went to an environmental science camp It was interesting and fun but after I discovered computing I knew Id rather spend the summer learning more about code indoors rather than swatting mosquitoes outdoors I thought Id continue to read all that I could find but my sister who lives in the Bay Area where Black Girls CODE originally started told my mom about BGC New York chapters hackathon and signed me upIt was a twoday hackathon where we built apps to combat domestic violence My team won and so we went to another hackathon at the Essence Festival in New Orleans and I got to mentor another group who won second prizeI feel that if I hadnt participated in BGC I wouldnt have discovered the greater possibilities around computer sciencethe fun parts There were no CS programs at my school so I was kind of on my own Its funny but I really relate to the brogrammer stereotype studying alone in my bedroom huddled over my computer in the dark What I discovered through BGC is that I enjoy coding in a group so much more than by myself Through BGC I also realized I didnt have to divide myself between art and computer scienceI can do bothDo you have any role models who have helped you along the way Do you plan to mentor other young women in the futureI did not have a role model in the literal sense In the beginning I was really only trying to see what I could learn on my own through online tutorials and group forums After I went to a couple BGC meetups I met a college student named Brianna Fugate I aspired to be like her because not only was she so knowledgeable she actively reached out to her community and mentored younger girls I respect and prioritize that I also have a lot of admiration for some female game designers that I follow on TwitterComputer science curriculum was nonexistent at my school when I was first starting out I consider myself pretty lucky to now be attending a high school thats well known for having a strong computer science program as well as a very active community of students who have a real passion for it Im excited to see what kind of programmer and artist Ill become over the next few years in this environmentProfessionally I want to work in STEM education I think its really meaningful and important to make technology more diverse STEM education and artthe intersection there is really important and coolWhat are some of your favorite projects that youve worked on What accomplishments are you most proud ofIm pretty proud of the project Im working on now for Uncharted Play Ive been developing a tabletop game to cement the topics within their core curriculum and to encourage convergent and divergent thinking in children Despite being aimed at elementary schoolers however adults seem to find it pretty funAnother project I worked on at summer camp before  th grade was published to the App Store which felt really good to say just now Its called SuperBlock Its an infinite runner similar to games like Temple Run where you play as a rectangle thats secretly a superhero Your superpower gives you the option of growing taller or smaller However when you grow bigger youre too heavy to jump The obstacles coming toward you come in varying sizes When youre big you can just smash through the large obstacles but you have to quickly shrink to jump over the shorter ones The game speeds up slowly to increase the difficulty while allowing users to learn how to play Through Black Girls CODE I was able to present SuperBlock in front of hundreds of people including White House CTO Megan Smith at the      MAKERS Conference While there remains a graveyard of unfinished projects on my computer I think I will always be proud of that oneWhat does the future hold for you Do you have specific ideas about what you would like to doI definitely want to keep making games Id love to make a living off of developing games independently However I doubt Id be able to make the next big thing right awaythose kinds of things rarely happen on accidentA really awesome job would be working in STEM education I currently am the codirector of this organization of highschool students that put on STEM events in New York City Were called The Young Hackers and weve been around since      The thing I adore most about working here is that I get to see real impact on my community We create inspiring and inclusive spaces where children from all backgrounds and identities can discover what CS can offer them I also really love teaching Ive been volunteering at Black Girls CODE most recently as a Technical Instructor A few weeks ago I taught a class full of twenty young girls between the ages of six and nine how to build apps in MIT App Inventor I spent a good portion of a hackathon last weekend making a tutorial on web games in Phaser for a workshop I am planning Working at places like Khan Academy Sesame Workshop or even making learning games like I do for Uncharted Play would be amazing to continue to do in the futureWhat advice would you give to a young black woman who is wondering about how to get into technology but is feeling discouraged or nervousI think that if someone wants to get into the field of technology you should know straight away that finding people who look like you is going to be very difficult I have yet to go to a hackathon that the Young Hackers didnt organize where I could quickly find another black girl Dont have any shame in taking advantage of every single opportunity They dont exist to make things easier They exist to level the playing fieldEven if you find that some places are hostile theres someone somewhere who wants you to work for them Its important to know that there are inclusive spaces if you look for them where you can go and create where people want to see you do wellThere are tons of ways to support Black Girls CODE and help young people get the foundation they need to do something amazing with technology

attended a class that helped you build your first GitHub Pages site  Recent improvements to GitHub Pages have made it easier to publish your site from a variety of sources  One of these sources is your repositorys docs folderQuality documentation is a hallmark of any healthy software project  For opensource projects however maintaining a robust compendium of knowledge detailing all the ins and outs is paramount  Wellcurated documentation increases your projects approachability provides asynchronous guidance and fosters the type of uncoordinated collaboration that propels opensource software developmentHosting your documentation on the web can present timeconsuming challenges that make publishing and maintaining it an unrewarding experience  one that its often easy to avoid  Grappling with multiple disparate publishing tools like FTP servers and databases means files often exist in various states and multiple locations all of which require manual synchronization  To be clear conventional web publishing provides unparalleled flexibility and power but it comes at the expense of simplicity and in many cases utilityWhen it comes to documentation a path with less resistance is often the better approachGitHub Pages gives you a direct path to create websites for your projects which makes it a natural choice for publishing and maintaining documentation  Because GitHub Pages supports Jekyll you can pen your documentation in plain text or Markdown to help maintain a lower barrier to contribution  Jekyll also includes support for many helpful tools like variables templates and automatic code highlighting which gives you much of the flexibility youd find in a bulkier platform without the added complexityMost importantly using GitHub Pages means your documentation lives alongside your code on GitHub where you can use things like Issues and Pull Requests to ensure it receives the high level of care it deserves and because GitHub Pages lets you publish from the docs directory on the master branch you can maintain your codebase and its published documentation on the same branchGet started todayPublishing your first documentation page only takes a few minutes  Create a docsindexmd file on your repositorys master branchAdd your content and any necessary Jekyll front matter then commit your changesGitHub Pages will read the contents of your docs directory convert the indexmd into HTML and publish the results at your GitHub Pages URLThis will generate the most basic HTML output that you can further customize with templates CSS and other features available in Jekyll  To see examples of what all is possible take a look at the GitHub Pages ShowcaseWere pleased to announce that version    of the GitHub Extension for Visual Studio is now available

fixes available in our release notesAs we focus our efforts on building workflows targeted towards maintainers and contributors wed love to hear your thoughts on how we can improve our tools Let us know what works and what doesnt and how to make your coding and collaboration workflows easierAuthored by GitHub Campus Expert NickTikhonovThis tutorial will teach you how to write your first package for the Atom text editor Well be building a clone of Sourcerer a plugin for finding and using code snippets from StackOverflow By the end of this tutorial you will have written a plugin that converts programming problems written in English into code snippets pulled from StackOverflowAtom is written using web technologies Our package will be built entirely using the EcmaScript   standard for JavaScript You will need to be familiar withYou can follow this tutorial stepbystep or check out the supplementary repository on GitHub which contains the plugin source code The repository history contains one commit for each step outlined hereDownload Atom by following the instructions on the Atom website We will also need to install apm the Atom Package Manager command line tool You can do this by opening Atom and navigating to Atom  Install Shell Commands in the application menu Check that apm was installed correctly by opening your command line terminal and running apm v which should print the version of the tool and related environmentsLets begin by creating a new package using a utility provided by AtomLaunch the editor and press CmdShiftP on MacOS or CtrlShiftP on WindowsLinux to open the Command PaletteSearch for Package Generator Generate Package and click the corresponding item on the list You will see a prompt where you can enter the name of the package  sourcefetchPress enter to generate the starter package which should automatically be opened in AtomIf you dont see package files appear in the sidebar press CmdK CmdB on MacOS or CtrlK CtrlB on WindowsLinuxThe Command Palette lets you find and run package commands using fuzzy search This is a convenient way to run commands without navigating menus or remembering shortcuts We will be using it throughout this tutorialLets try out the starter package before diving into the code itself We will first need to reload Atom to make it aware of the new package that was added Open the Command Palette again and run the Window Reload commandReloading the current window ensures that Atom runs the latest version of our source code We will be running this command every time we want to test the changes we make to our package   Run the package toggle command by navigating to Packages  sourcefetch  Toggle using the editor menu or run sourcefetch Toggle using the Command Palette You should see a black box appear at the top of the screen Hide it by running the command againLets open libsourcefetchjs which contains the package logic and defines the toggle commandtoggle is a function exported by the module It uses a ternary operator to call show and hide on the modal panel based on its visibility modalPanel is an instance of Panel a UI element provided by the Atom API We declare modalPanel inside export default which lets us access it as an instance variable with thisThe above statement tells Atom to execute toggle every time the user runs sourcefetchtoggle We subscribe an anonymous function   thistoggle to be called every time the command is run This is an example of eventdriven programming a common paradigm in JavaScriptCommands are nothing more than string identifiers for events triggered by the user defined within a package namespace Weve already usedPackages subscribe to commands in order to execute code in response to these eventsLets make our first code changewere going to change toggle to reverse text selected by the userReload Atom by running Window Reload in the Command PaletteNavigate to File  New to create a new file type anything you like and select it with the cursorRun the sourcefetchtoggle command using the Command Palette Atom menu or by right clicking and selecting Toggle sourcefetchThe updated command will toggle the order of the selected textSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryThe code we added uses the TextEditor API to access and manipulate the text inside the editor Lets take a closer lookThe first two lines obtain a reference to a TextEditor instance The variable assignment and following code is wrapped in a conditional to handle the case where there is no text editor instance available for example if the command was run while the user was in the settings menuCalling getSelectedText gives us access to text selected by the user If no text is currently selected the function returns an empty stringOur selected text is reversed using JavaScript String methods  Finally we call insertText to replace the selected text with the reversed counterpart You can learn more about the different TextEditor methods available by reading the Atom API documentationNow that weve made our first code change lets take a closer look at how an Atom package is organized by exploring the starter codeThe main file is the entrypoint to an Atom package Atom knows where to find the main file from an entry in packagejsonThe file exports an object with lifecycle functions which Atom calls on certain eventsactivate is called when the package is initially loaded by Atom This function is used to initialize objects such as user interface elements needed by the package and to subscribe handler functions to package commandsdeactivate is called when the package is deactivated for example when the editor is closed or refreshed by the userserialize is called by Atom to allow you to save the state of the package between uses The returned value is passed as an argument to activate when the package is next loaded by AtomWe are going to rename our package command to fetch and remove user interface elements we wont be using Update the file to match the version belowTo improve performance Atom packages can be lazy loading We can tell Atom to load our package only when certain commands are run by the user These commands are called activation commands and are defined in packagejsonUpdate this entry to make fetch an activation commandSome packages such as those which modify Atoms appearance need to be loaded on startup In those cases activationCommands can be omitted entirelyJSON files inside the menus folder specify which menu items are created for our package Lets take a look at menussourcefetchjsonThe contextmenu object lets us define new items in the rightclick menu Each item is defined by a label to be displayed in the menu and a command to run when the item is clickedThe menu object in the same file defines custom application menu items created for the package Were going to rename this entry as wellCommands can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts defined with JSON files in the keymaps directoryThe above lets package users call toggle with CtrlAltO on WindowsLinux or CmdAltO on MacOSRename the referenced command to fetchReload Atom by running the Window Reload command You should see that the application and rightclick menus are updated and the reverse functionality should work as beforeSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryNow that weve made our first code change and learned about Atom package structure lets introduce our first dependencya module from Node Package Manager npm We will use the request module to make HTTP requests and download the HTML of a website This functionality will be needed later to scrape StackOverflow pagesOpen your command line application navigate to your package root directory and runThese commands add the request Node module to our dependencies list and install the module into the node_modules directory You should see a new entry in packagejson The  symbol tells npm to install the specific version we will be using for this tutorial Running apm install lets Atom know to use our newly installed moduleImport request into our main file by adding an import statement to the top of libsourcefetchjsNow add a new function download to the modules exports below fetchThis function uses request to download the contents of a web page and logs the output to the Developer Console When the HTTP request completes our callback function will be called with the response as an argumentThe final step is to update fetch so that it calls downloadInstead of reversing the selected text fetch now treats the selection as a URL passing it to download Lets see our changes in actionReload Atom by running the Window Reload commandOpen the Developer Tools To do this navigate to View  Developer  Toggle Developer Tools in the menuCreate a new file navigate to File  NewEnter and select a URL for example httpwwwatomioRun our package command in any of the three ways previously describedDeveloper Tools make it easy to debug Atom packages Any consolelog statement will print to the interactive console and you can use the Elements tab to explore the visual structure of the whole applicatiowhich is just an HTML Document Object Model DOMSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryIdeally we would like our download function to return the HTML as a string instead of just printing page contents into the console Returning body wont work however since we get access to body inside of the callback rather than download itselfWe will solve this problem by returning a Promise rather than the value itself Lets change download to return a PromisePromises allow us to return values obtained asynchronously by wrapping asynchronous logic in a function that provides two callbacks resolve for returning a value successfully and reject for notifying the caller of an error We call reject if an error is returned by request and resolve the HTML otherwiseLets change fetch to work with the Promise returned by downloadIn our new version of fetch we get access to the HTML by calling then on the Promise returned by download This lets us insert the HTML into the editor We also accept and handle any errors returned by calling catch We handle errors by displaying a warning notification using the Atom Notification APILets see what changed Reload Atom and run the package command on a selected URLIf the command is run on an invalid URL a warning notification will be displayedSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryThe next step involves extracting code snippets from the HTML of a StackOverflow page we obtained in the previous step In particular were interested in code from the accepted answeran answer chosen to be correct by the question author We can greatly simplify our package implementation by assuming any such answer to be relevant and correctThis section assumes you are using the Chrome web browser You may be able to follow along using another browser but instructions may changeLets take a look at a typical StackOverflow page that contains an accepted answer with a code snippet We are going to explore the HTML using Chrome Developer ToolsOpen Chrome and navigate to any StackOverflow page containing an accepted answer with code such as this hello world example in Python or this question about reading text from a file in CScroll down to the accepted answer and highlight a section of the code snippetRight click and select InspectInspect the location of the code snippet within the HTML code using the Elements browserNote that the document has the following structureThe accepted answer is denoted by a div with class acceptedanswerBlock code snippets are located inside a pre elementElements that render the code snippet itself sit inside a code tagNow lets construct a jQuery statement for extracting code snippetsClick the Console tab within Developer Tools to access the JavaScript consoleType divacceptedanswer pre codetext into the console and press EnterYou should see the accepted answer code snippets printed out in the console The code we just ran uses a special  function provided by jQuery  accepts a query string to select and return certain HTML elements from the website Lets take a look at how this code works by considering a couple of intermediate example queriesThe above query will match all div elements that contain the class acceptedanswer in our case  just one divBuilding upon the previous this query will match any code element that is inside a pre element contained within the previously matched divThe text function extracts and concatenates all text from the list of elements that would otherwise be returned by the previous query This also strips out elements used for syntax highlighting purposes from the codeOur next step involves using the query we created to implement a scraping function using Cheerio a jQuery implementation for serverside applicationsOur scraping function is implemented in just two lines because cheerio does all of the work for us We create a  function by calling load with our HTML string and use this function to run our jQuery statement and return the results You can explore the entire Cheerio API in their developer documentationIf we run the command on a page with an accepted answer it will be inserted into the editorIf we run the command on a page with no accepted answer a warning notification will be displayed insteadOur new iteration of fetch gives us the code snippet within a StackOverflow page instead of the entire HTML contents Note that our updated fetch function checks for the absence of an answer and displays a notification to alert the userSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryNow that we can turn StackOverflow URLs into code snippets lets implement our final function search which will return a relevant URL given the description of a snippet such as hello world or quicksort We will be using Google search via the unofficial google npm module which allows us to search programmaticallyAdd an import statement for google at the top of libsourcefetchjsWe will configure the library to limit the number of results returned during search Add the following line below the import statement to limit returned results to just the top oneNext lets implement our search function itselfThe code above searches Google for a StackOverflow page relevant to the given query and programming language returning the URL of the top result Lets take a look at how it worksWe construct the search string using the query entered by the user and the current language selected For example if the user types hello world  while editing Python the query will be hello world in python sitestackoverflowcom The final part of the string is a filter provided by Google Search that lets us limit results to those linked to StackOverflowWe wrap the call to google inside a Promise so that we can return our URL asynchronously We propagate any errors returned by the library also returning an error when there are no results available We resolve the URL of the top result otherwiseOur final step is to update fetch to use searchLets take a look at what changedOur selected text is now treated as the query entered by the userWe obtain the language of the current editor tab using the TextEditor APIWe call search to obtain a URL which we access by calling then on the resulting PromiseInstead of calling then on the Promise returned by download we instead return the Promise itself and chain another then call onto the original call This helps us avoid callback hellSee all code changes for this step in the sourcefetch tutorial repositoryAnd were done See the final plugin in action by reloading Atom and running our package command on a problem description and dont forget to select a language in the bottomright cornerNow that

offers     and unfortunately your browser doesnt allow us to do this We know you cant always switch but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome     Makers Academy is a fully immersive fulltime computer programming course in London designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into jobready junior developers in just    weeks Were Europes   Developer Bootcamp running new classes of    students every   weeks in the heart of Londons Tech City  every    weeks from the comfort of your own homeBeing a student at Makers Academy is a very emotional journey Eating sleeping and breathing code becomes a huge part of your life but looking after your wellbeing is also critical to becoming a great developer On site we have Dana our Chief Joy Officer  a certified yoga instructor who runs daily yoga and meditation classes and is here to look after your well being but dont worry if youre a remote student Dana can also provide remote check ins too and send resources on how to develop your own meditation practiseIts also important to unwind and bond socially with your cohort Were surrounded by some of Londons quirkiest cafes yummiest street food and busiest pubs We host regular events such as Petcha Kutcha lightning talks games nights karaoke nights as well as organising group activities like climbing gokarting and going to the theatre Remote students are encouraged to start engaging wih their local tech community and if another Remote student is near you we encourage you to meet up and bondOur mission is to teach as many people as possible to create amazing products using beautiful code Since we started in early      weve grown from two people to a team of twenty We are not just colleagues were a family The Makers Academy team is a diverse bunch who work hard and play hard           Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs           Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market At the same time Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him   months and    hours a week to get through it A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers and something had to be done         About   months after that conversation they started their first cohort  in February       creating Makers Academy  an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in   hyperintensive months in London Before we knew it forcing people to move to London in order to learn to code felt far too limiting so in February      we launched Makers Academy Remote codenamed Ronin a course that leverages everything weve learned at Makers Academy to help people all over the world learn to code  from the comfort of their own homeMakers Academy has now been going for over   years and has graduated over     studentsPaul Graham the tech startup visionary behind YCombinator coined the term Maker for those individuals that truly produce The Makers Academy mission is to give every student the skills to call themselves a MakerMakers Academy officially runs  am to  pm Monday to Friday at the Makers Academy studio in Shoreditch at      Commercial St  right at the centre of the tech startup community a few minutes away from Shoreditch High Street station and Google Campus We welcome anyone who wants to arrange a visit to see how we operateAbsolutely Programming expertise takes years to master but thats not the point of Makers Academy We want to give you a foundation so that you can be a top candidate for an entrylevel position at a world class startup or technology company Whether youre looking to change careers or you want to start your own startup but cant find a technical cofounder Makers Academy is for you To learn more about the underlying research see this essay on Why Learning to Code is So HardAt the moment we do not have a dedicated housing department but members of our team can assist you with finding short term accommodation in London In the past students have used sites like Gumtree Zoopla Spareroomcouk and many others to find a house In London its pretty easy to find a room at short notice if you put your mind to itIndeed we do Sign up to our mailing list to be notified when tickets go on saleThe company was formed in November      and we ran our first course in February     Of course Our doors are open for anyone to come and visit Book an appointment with one of our team hereWhile we dont set specific limits on how many students we accept typically about    of applicants end up studying at Makers Academy We have a rigorous selection process designed to find the most capable driven and passionate people and we arent afraid to turn people away if we dont think they have what it takes to succeed at Makers Academy Its not called Oxbridge meets the Marines but for Developers for nothingAfter submitting your online application well invite you for an interview In the interview well ask a few questions and do a bit of simple pair programming You have no need to be afraid  were not testing to see if you can already code Were testing to see how you handle stressful situations where youre navigating the unknown Itll be fun  we promiseIn truth there isnt a huge amount you can do to improve your chances at the interview stage  other than following the instructions we give you and studying the materials that we recommend Its designed to find people who have natural reasoning skills bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code Were not testing whether youve memorised syntax  were testing whether you can follow instructions and have the passion to learn some basic code without our support The following articles will help you develop the sorts of behaviours and skills we look for in a candidateHaving said that if you do already have some coding experience even if you only went through a few introductory tutorials this will be to your advantage We recommend the following resources to get started as a web developer regardless of whether you want to join Makers Academy or notThe interview is designed to test how you think rather than what you know but going through Learn to Program by Chris Pine or the Ruby Essentials course on lyndacom will put you in a great position when it comes to the pair programming part of the interviewNo All you need is passion and the ability to unlearn the word quitAbsolutely Makers Academy is more than just learning how to program  its learning how to be a developer Its learning how to build your own prototypes Its learning where to go to find answers Its learning about what the atmosphere of working in a startup is really like Its learning to be a Maker from some of the best Makers in the worldAbsolutely Weve had students from all over Europe the USA Singapore Hong Kong South Africa Pakistan Australia New Zealand and even VenezuelaWe welcome International Students Weve had people join us from France Germany The USA even South Africa The course cost is the same wherever youre from and you apply in the normal way We are not legally able to assist or advise on visa related issues so we would advise you to obtain the services of a professional visa organisationIts a bit of a cliche that coding is all about Maths Computer Science is Maths heavy Writing code not so much In reality anything above IfElse statements and simple ANDOR logic is done largely by the computer Its more important that you have the right sort of mentality that youre comfortable working in the unknown and that you arent afraid to fail So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths youve got everything you needThere is a huge spectrum of learning difficulties and we would never generalize to say that any learning difficulty would make our course unattainable Weve had a number of students with dyslexia do very well on the course but please feel free to get in touch to discuss your personal requirements While were not experts in this field we will do everything we can to support anyone who is serious about learning to codeWe dont track the number specifically but weve had students from all over Europe the USA Singapore Hong Kong South Africa Australia New Zealand and even VenezuelaMakers Academy is taught by a cadre of worldclass technologists and entrepreneurs They have founded various technology startups and have decades of educational experience between them In addition Makers Academy brings in world class speakers from top London technology companiesCurrently we only offer our fulltime course because we dont believe we could deliver a worldclass result on a parttime basis  yet One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning The   week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and were not yet certain how we could deliver that with a parttime regimentbut were working on it Stay tunedNo Makers Academy will provide all of the equipment needed That being said feel free to bring your own laptop if youd like as long as its a Mac or a Linux the software youll be using is really hard to use on Microsoft WindowsBy far the best way to learn to code in such a short amount of time is to live and breathe it You would need to attend Makers Academy from  am pm MondayFriday for the    weeks that youre studying Bear in mind that this is a minimum requirement  the more time you give to the course the better the results will be If you absolutely cannot make it to London we have a new fulltime online program that mirrors our offline courseStudents will be at Makers Academy from  am until  pm although many stay well into the evening Monday through Friday for the duration of the    week course We use a combination of selfstudy classbased instruction handson exercises and pair programming to give you a wellrounded overview of how to apply each new conceptOur agile approach means we improve our course and curriculum with each cohort but you can get a flavour of the structure from our curriculumYes We have developed a part time PreCourse that needs to be completed before starting the course We focus on the foundations commandline version control and the basics of Ruby The PreCourse requires an average of      hours per week to complete successfullyThe fact that weve had over     students graduate from Makers Academy and our track record in getting students hired at companies like BSkyB Pivotal Labs ThoughtWorks and many other top tech companies mean that YES it is possible to learn to code in    Weeks Make no mistake  it will be tough It will take hard work and dedication but if you really want it its there to be hadThe course doesnt just focus on Ruby on Rails Youll learn a number of languages such as Ruby HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery and more but youre right in saying that you will leave Makers Academy with Ruby as your strongest language However we focus much of our efforts on teaching you the skills to think like a Developer note the capital D and our graduates have gone on to work in a number of programming languages after leaving Makers AcademyTowards the end of the course students work in teams on a project Everyone is invited to pitch an idea and after a couple of rounds of voting we construct teams based on project choice Two weeks later the team present their projects to friends and family as part of their graduationWhile youll get a taste of many languages while studying we offer one course and one course only and Ruby forms its backbone If youre sure that you want to learn a language like Python or C then the course may not be for youWe do touch on Agile working methodologies and even some Lean Startup principles but this isnt the main focus of the course nor is design You will learn some basic principles in all these areas but this is primarily a course where you will learn to codeOur Net Promoter Score as decided by feedback from all students over the past year is    The highest you can get is a     and anything above    is considered to be ExcellentOut of around     students so far we have had around    drop out for various reasons We have an applicationinterview process at Makers Academy that is designed to only accept people who are serious about learning to code but we cant always get it rightTheres no such thing as too old Our students are incredibly diverse  people of all ages backgrounds sectors and experiences  so we dont have a maximum age limit The one thing that has been constant with all of our applicants is a passion for coding and a burning determination to succeedNo Remote students are expected to commit to  am to  pm Monday to Friday at a minimum but most work well into the evening to finish their work We also set weekend project work to keep you engaged so if you really want to get to a professional standard in just a few months you really have to commit to itYes The value of a fulltime course is huge in comparison to a parttime course We dont offer a parttime option because it wouldnt produce world class developersYou dont get a qualification when graduating Makers Academy Remote you get a job To be an official educational institution and to offer qualifications we would need to submit our curriculum to the government which would then get locked down without the possibility of any changes

however assist with making arrangements in any way that we can  feel free to email us with any questions or requests that you may haveDue to high demand for spaces we ask that once accepted students pay a nonrefundable     deposit to lockdown their spot on the course This is to ensure that every place is taken by someone who actually intends to study at Makers Academy Many courses end up with a waiting list and it isnt fair on waiting students for people to reserve a spot and not show upOnce a student is accepted on to the course their spot is held for    days In this time the seat will not be offered to anyone else If the deposit is not paid within    days their application will be automatically archived As the course is very selective and highly popular it will most likely mean the seat will be offered to someone elseBooks are kind of outdated in the fastpaced world of software development You wont need any on the course but we can recommend some if youre really after some

Hey It looks like youre using an old browser  here at Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cuttingedge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesnt allow us to do this We know you cant always switch but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome     We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum weve created We currently use a mixture of workshops exercises projects classroom breakout sessions and endofweek challenges to help our students understand programming The immersive environment having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational processCoding is more than syntax The best developers see themselves as ArtisansWe prefer code written in pairs over code written by lonewolvesDoing it right and going a little slower is always better than moving fast and ignoring best practiseYou can read about riding a bike til the cows come home unless you actually try riding one youre unlikely to be competing in the Tour de France any time soonIt doesnt matter how much you pay a personal trainer  you still have to do the squats As with training so with learningYou have to be well to learn well so we encourage our students to take care of their health  through  yoga meditation and keeping fit             Read more about our Manifesto                      If youre onsite           weve got table tennis yoga discussion groups excessive N   gaming and the odd NERF battle These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact Of course theres also an enormous amount of coding While no two days are identical heres a general sense of what an average day might look like         Relate what you did yesterday what youre planning on doing today where you got stuck and how you got unstuck Lots of clapping and feelgoodsStudents are introduced to key programming skills in isolation and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff or visualise things using a board or visualisation technology if youre a remote studentStudents pair with each other either in person or remotely throughout the morning building real stuff using tools and practices wed expect from a professional junior developerOur cohorts tend to lunch together Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditchs fine local eateries and theres often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak toProgramming is extremely challenging Meditation helps keep a lid on things keeps you grounded and keeps your brain sharpThe afternoon is spent pair programming as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculumA pecha kucha night a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer a hosted event or a film nightwe love to organise stuff to keep your social bar topped up If youre a remote student why not game together online Or even meet up if youre near each other             Read more about our Coaching style           In the four weeks preceding the fulltime course all students are required to complete a very important parttime PreCourse which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy In the first week we focus on the foundations first the commandline which is key to navigating around your computer second youll tackle version control using Git and Github This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges The PreCourse requires at least    hours per week to complete successfully but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse the betterThe main topics of week   are testdriven development and objectoriented programming By now students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes This week we start creating our own classes in a testdriven way The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects The Friday challenge involves writing a simple objectoriented system of interacting classesThis week we delve into more complex testdriven development and objectoriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics lambdas vs procs composition vs inheritance iterators and recursion The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core libraryBy now students are comfortable using Ruby and writing objectoriented code in a testdriven way In week   we focus on the fundamentals of the web HTTP protocols the Sinatra framework HTML  CSS We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to HerokuIts time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper In this week we talk about relational databases keyvalue stores and SQL We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts hashing and salting choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks Students write a user management system sign up sign in sign out etc from scratch paying special attention to the security aspects Finally students also learn how to use Capybara to testdrive web applications The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web developmentNow that students can build testdriven secure databasebacked web applications its time to start talking about other frontend technologies JavaScript jQuery AJAX and responsive design Students begin learning their second language JavaScript also known as the language of the web The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the frontend of one of the most popular websites in the worldThis week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace Working on a set project in small groups students will learn Git workflow QA StandupsScrums Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeksIn week   we start working with Ruby on Rails By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby the web HTTP HTML JavaScript etc and have experience using databases Armed with all this knowledge they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it This week we talk about ActiveRecord the asset pipeline routing and Rails architecture The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on RailsStudents expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning a frontend JavaScript frameworkThis week we consolidate our learning by building a fullstack project using everything weve learnt from the previous weeks Agile Git workflow User Stories and teamwork are revisited in another team based projectBy now students are confident junior developers To put their skills to their test they build a final project that shows how far theyve come since they started This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final projectEarly in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code There is no Friday challenge Instead we have a graduation ceremony followed by a party attended by friends families hiring partners recruiters exstudents and prospective students of Makers AcademyThis week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team They focus on honing lifelong learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market This could include technical tests working on opensource code or even working on projects
