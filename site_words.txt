stuff they learn are behaviours attitudes and methodologiesOur software developers are mostly in London and Manchester with many in other UK cities and parts of Europe and USA However were growing

Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cuttingedge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesnt allow us to do this We know you cant always switch but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome     We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum weve created We currently use a mixture of workshops exercises projects classroom breakout sessions and endofweek challenges to help our students understand programming The immersive environment having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational processCoding is more than syntax The best developers see themselves as ArtisansWe prefer code written in pairs over code written by lonewolvesDoing it right and going a little slower is always better than moving fast and ignoring best practiseYou can read about riding a bike til the cows come home unless you actually try riding one youre unlikely to be competing in the Tour de France any time soonIt doesnt matter how much you pay a personal trainer  you still have to do the squats As with training so with learningYou have to be well to learn well so we encourage our students to take care of their health  through  yoga meditation and keeping fit             Read more about our Manifesto                      If youre onsite           weve got table tennis yoga discussion groups excessive N   gaming and the odd NERF battle These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact Of course theres also an enormous amount of coding While no two days are identical heres a general sense of what an average day might look like         Relate what you did yesterday what youre planning on doing today where you got stuck and how you got unstuck Lots of clapping and feelgoodsStudents are introduced to key programming skills in isolation and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff or visualise things using a board or visualisation technology if youre a remote studentStudents pair with each other either in person or remotely throughout the morning building real stuff using tools and practices wed expect from a professional junior developerOur cohorts tend to lunch together Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditchs fine local eateries and theres often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak toProgramming is extremely challenging Meditation helps keep a lid on things keeps you grounded and keeps your brain sharpThe afternoon is spent pair programming as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculumA pecha kucha night a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer a hosted event or a film nightwe love to organise stuff to keep your social bar topped up If youre a remote student why not game together online Or even meet up if youre near each other             Read more about our Coaching style           In the four weeks preceding the fulltime course all students are required to complete a very important parttime PreCourse which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy In the first week we focus on the foundations first the commandline which is key to navigating around your computer second youll tackle version control using Git and Github This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges The PreCourse requires a minimum of    hours per week to complete successfully but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse the better Each Friday during the PreCourse we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students learning and check in on their progressThe main topics of week   are testdriven development and objectoriented programming By now students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes This week we start creating our own classes in a testdriven way The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects The Friday challenge involves writing a simple objectoriented system of interacting classesThis week we delve into more complex testdriven development and objectoriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics lambdas vs procs composition vs inheritance iterators and recursion The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core libraryBy now students are comfortable using Ruby and writing objectoriented code in a testdriven way In week   we focus on the fundamentals of the web HTTP protocols the Sinatra framework HTML  CSS We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to HerokuIts time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper In this week we talk about relational databases keyvalue stores and SQL We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts hashing and salting choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks Students write a user management system sign up sign in sign out etc from scratch paying special attention to the security aspects Finally students also learn how to use Capybara to testdrive web applications The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web developmentNow that students can build testdriven secure databasebacked web applications its time to start talking about other frontend technologies JavaScript jQuery AJAX and responsive design Students begin learning their second language JavaScript also known as the language of the web The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the frontend of one of the most popular websites in the worldThis week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace Working on a set project in small groups students will learn Git workflow QA StandupsScrums Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeksIn week   we start working with Ruby on Rails By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby the web HTTP HTML JavaScript etc and have experience using databases Armed with all this knowledge they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it This week we talk about ActiveRecord the asset pipeline routing and Rails architecture The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on RailsStudents expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning a frontend JavaScript frameworkThis week we consolidate our learning by building a fullstack project using everything weve learnt from the previous weeks Agile Git workflow User Stories and teamwork are revisited in another team based projectBy now students are confident junior developers To put their skills to their test they build a final project that shows how far theyve come since they started This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final projectEarly in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code There is no Friday challenge Instead we have a graduation ceremony followed by a party attended by friends families hiring partners recruiters exstudents and prospective students of Makers AcademyThis week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team They focus on honing lifelong learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market This could include technical tests working on opensource code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs this is a great week to start working on your

you to meet up and bondOur mission is to teach as many people as possible to create amazing products using beautiful code Since we started in early      weve grown from two people to a team of twenty We are not just colleagues were a family The Makers Academy team is a diverse bunch who work hard and play hard           Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs           Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market At the same time Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him   months and    hours a week to get through it A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers and something had to be done         About   months after that conversation they started their first cohort  in February       creating Makers Academy  an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in   hyperintensive months in London Before we knew it forcing people to move to London in order to learn to code felt far too limiting so in February      we launched Makers Academy Remote codenamed Ronin a course that leverages everything weve learned at Makers Academy to help people all over the world learn to code  from the comfort of their own homeMakers Academy has now been going for over   years and has graduated over     studentsPaul Graham the tech startup visionary behind YCombinator coined the term Maker for those individuals that truly produce

succeed at Makers Academy Its not called Oxbridge meets the Marines but for Developers for nothingAfter submitting your online application well invite you for an interview In the interview well ask a few questions and do a bit of simple pair programming You have no need to be afraid  were not testing to see if you can already code Were testing to see how you handle stressful situations where youre navigating the unknown Itll be fun  we promiseIn truth there isnt a huge amount you can do to improve your chances at the interview stage  other than following the instructions we give you and studying the materials that we recommend Its designed to find people who have natural reasoning skills bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code Were not testing whether youve memorised syntax  were testing whether you can follow instructions and have the passion to learn some basic code without our support The following articles will help you develop the sorts of behaviours and skills we look for in a candidateHaving said that if you do already have some coding experience even if you only went through a few introductory tutorials this will be to your advantage We recommend the following resources to get started as a web developer regardless of whether you want to join Makers Academy or notThe interview is designed to test how you think rather than what you know but going through Learn to Program by Chris Pine or the Ruby Essentials course on lyndacom will put you in a great position when it comes to the pair programming part of the interviewNo All you need is passion and the ability to unlearn the word quitAbsolutely Makers Academy is more than just learning how to program  its learning how to be a developer Its learning how to build your own prototypes Its learning where to go to find answers Its learning about what the atmosphere of working in a startup is really like Its learning to be a Maker from some of the best Makers in the worldAbsolutely Weve had students from all over Europe the USA Singapore Hong Kong South Africa Pakistan Australia New Zealand and even VenezuelaWe welcome International Students Weve had people join us from France Germany The USA even South Africa The course cost is the same wherever youre from and you apply in the normal way We are not legally able to assist or advise on visa related issues so we would advise you to obtain the services of a professional visa organisationIts a bit of a cliche that coding is all about Maths Computer Science is Maths heavy Writing code not so much In reality anything above IfElse statements and simple ANDOR logic is done largely by the computer Its more important that you have the right sort of mentality that youre comfortable working in the unknown and that you arent afraid to fail So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths youve got everything you needThere is a huge spectrum of learning difficulties and we would never generalize to say that any learning difficulty would make our course unattainable Weve had a number of students with dyslexia do very well on the course but please feel free to get in touch to discuss your personal requirements While were not experts in this field we will do everything we can to support anyone who is serious about learning to codeWe dont track the number specifically but weve had students from all over Europe the USA Singapore Hong Kong South Africa Australia New Zealand and even VenezuelaMakers Academy is taught by a cadre of worldclass technologists and entrepreneurs They have founded various technology startups and have decades of educational experience between them In addition Makers Academy brings in world class speakers from top London technology companiesCurrently we only offer our fulltime course because we dont believe we could deliver a worldclass result on a parttime basis  yet One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning The   week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and were not yet certain how we could deliver that with a parttime regimentbut were working on it Stay tunedNo Makers Academy will provide all of the equipment needed That being said feel free to bring your own laptop if youd like as long as its a Mac or a Linux the software youll be using is really hard to use on Microsoft WindowsBy far the best way to learn to code in such a short amount of time is to live and breathe it You would need to attend Makers Academy from  am pm MondayFriday for the    weeks that youre studying Bear in mind that this is a minimum requirement  the more time you give to the course the better the results will be If you absolutely cannot make it to London we have a new fulltime online program that mirrors our offline courseStudents will be at Makers Academy from  am until  pm although many stay well into the evening Monday through Friday for the duration of the    week course We use a combination of selfstudy classbased instruction handson exercises and pair programming to give you a wellrounded overview of how to apply each new conceptOur agile approach means we improve our course and curriculum with each cohort but you can get a flavour of the structure from our curriculumYes We have developed a part time PreCourse that needs to be completed before starting the course We focus on the foundations commandline version control and the basics of Ruby The PreCourse requires an average of      hours per week to complete successfullyThe fact that weve had over     students graduate from Makers Academy and our track record in getting students hired at companies like BSkyB Pivotal Labs ThoughtWorks and many other top tech companies mean that YES it is possible to learn to code in    Weeks Make no mistake  it will be tough It will take hard work and dedication but if you really want it its there to be hadThe course doesnt just focus on Ruby on Rails Youll learn a number of languages such as Ruby HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery and more but youre right in saying that you will leave Makers Academy with Ruby as your strongest language However we focus much of our efforts on teaching you the skills to think like a Developer note the capital D and our graduates have gone on to work in a number of programming languages after leaving Makers AcademyTowards the end of the course students work in teams on a project Everyone is invited to pitch an idea and after a couple of rounds of voting we construct teams based on project choice Two weeks later the team present their projects to friends and family as part of their graduationWhile youll get a taste of many languages while studying we offer one course and one course only and Ruby forms its backbone If youre sure that you want to learn a language like Python or C then the course may not be for youWe do touch on Agile working methodologies and even some Lean Startup principles but this isnt the main focus of the course nor is design You will learn some basic principles in all these areas but this is primarily a course where you will learn to codeOur Net Promoter Score as decided by feedback from all students over the past year is    The highest you can get is a     and anything above    is considered to be ExcellentOut of around     students so far we have had around    drop out for various reasons We have an applicationinterview process at Makers Academy that is designed to only accept people who are serious about learning to code but we cant always get it rightTheres no such thing as too old Our students are incredibly diverse  people of all ages backgrounds sectors and experiences  so we dont have a maximum age limit The one thing that has been constant with all of our applicants is a passion for coding and a burning determination to succeedNo Remote students are expected to commit to  am to  pm Monday to Friday at a minimum but most work well into the evening to finish their work We also set weekend project work to keep you engaged so if you really want to get to a professional standard in just a few months you really have to commit to itYes The value of a fulltime course is huge in comparison to a parttime course We dont offer a parttime option because it wouldnt produce world class developersYou dont get a qualification when graduating Makers Academy Remote you get a job To be an official educational institution and to offer qualifications we would need to submit our curriculum to the government which would then get locked down without the possibility of any changes Accreditation guidelines say that you have to teach the same thing for a minimum of   year before you can apply for an official qualification Well  a year in software development is a lifetime in other industries We update our course materials every   weeks to fit the needs of the market and the needs of our hiring partners so we do not and will never offer official accreditation We dont care for fancy pieces of paper  we want you to leave the course with the ability to build real projects Thats our qualificationWe dont have any requirements other than a passion for coding and a commitment to learning You dont need any academic qualifications or work experience  just demonstrate to us that youre keen and capableWe run a new course every    weeks and you can take a look at all of our upcoming cohorts at the bottom of this pageThe interviews for Makers Academy Remote are done remotely to mimic the learning environment youll be in Well also send you across some learning materials to prepare for the interview so remember to complete all of the content to give yourself the best chance of progressing to the next stageThe PreCourse is part time and is completed remotely You need around    hours per week including weekends to complete the required work Weekly progress is compulsory on the PreCourse to make your way onto the fulltime courseDefinitely Our course is designed to turn any coding beginner into a junior developer in    weeks and then get you a job in a worldclass tech company after you graduate Sound too good to be true It isnt we do it over and over again every    weeks If you fancy a read you can take a look at our graduate stories hereThe majority of our hiring partners are in London but weve helped graduates get jobs all over the world As we get more Remote students well be handpicking the top tech employers across Europe to work with usMakers Academy Remote costs      Weve partnered with Finance my Future PCDL and EdAid to offer financial support Ask about this during your interview Hint you need to apply firstWe offer scholarships from time to time usually in partnership with another company By far the best way to hear about these things is by signing up to our newsletter and keeping an eye out for any new opportunitiesWhilst we do have some international students join Makers Academy Remote because of time differences do bear in mind that we dont recommend joining the course if you are located somewhere that is more than   hours GMT Feel free to drop us an email if you want to have a chat about this in greater detailWe cover a range of content that includes languages libraries processes and frameworks such as                     Front end  HTML CSS JavaScript                    Back end  Ruby Ruby on Rails NodeJS                    Databases  DataMapper SQL and user management                    Object Oriented Programming                    Test Driven Development  Pair Programming                    Agile and lots moreAbsolutely We want to help in any way that we can  be that helping a student find their first or second or third position or just merely providing advice We have built an extensive alumni network for all graduates We now have a full time team to look after all post course arrangements and ensure you get a jobWhile its really complicated publishing our success metrics were committed to fully supporting you until youre happy in your new job as a developerNo Certifications would require us to bend our curriculum to a governing body thus reducing our agility to teach whats most relevant and to stay at the bleeding edge of whats important to the technology community Also the employers pay little attention to certificates but they value the skills so we focus on the latterOn average it takes    months to get a job after graduationWe train you to a level of proficiency that will allow you to build your own prototypes if youre an entrepreneur or to get a job as Junior DeveloperThe tech landscape moves fast There are jobs available in every language  from C and Java right through Python and Ruby to Node and Clojure With demand for Devs growing an average of    every year and the supply of devs flatlining at   YoY the reality is that if youre a good programmer youll always be in demandWe dont offer any formal support but most of the team have extensive experience in startups and were happy to talk to the students about their ideasThere are a number of ways you can raise funds Check our payments page to see how previous students have done thisUnfortunately not We will however assist with making arrangements in any way that we can  feel free to email us with any questions or requests that you may haveDue to high demand for spaces we ask that once accepted students pay a nonrefundable     deposit to lockdown their spot on the course This is to ensure that every place is taken by someone who actually intends to study at Makers Academy Many courses end up with a waiting list and it isnt fair on waiting students for people to reserve a spot and not show upOnce a student is accepted on to the course their spot is held for    days In this time the seat will not be offered to anyone else If the deposit is not paid within    days their application will be automatically archived As the course is very selective and highly popular it will most likely mean the seat will be offered to someone elseBooks are kind of outdated in the fastpaced world of software development You wont need any on the course but we can recommend some if youre really after some physical materialsYes  we welcome payment in Bitcoin If you want to do so we can talk about how to do so when you come for an interviewWe offer scholarships from time to time usually in partnership with another company By far the best way to hear about these things is by signing up to our newsletter and keeping an eye out for any new opportunitiesDeliveryCurriculumPair
