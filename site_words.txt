It looks like you're using an old browser - here at Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cutting-edge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesn't allow us to do this. We know you can't always switch, but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.     We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we've created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.Coding is more than syntax. The best developers see themselves as Artisans.We prefer code written in pairs over code written by lone-wolves.Doing it right and going a little slower is always better than moving fast and ignoring best practise.You can read about riding a bike 'til the cows come home; unless you actually try riding one, you're unlikely to be competing in the Tour de France any time soon.It doesn't matter how much you pay a personal trainer - you still have to do the squats! As with training, so with learning.You have to be well to learn well, so we encourage our students to take care of their health - through  yoga, meditation and keeping fit.             Read more about our Manifesto                      If you're onsite           we’ve got table tennis, yoga, discussion groups, excessive N   gaming, and the odd NERF battle. These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact. Of course, there's also an enormous amount of coding. While no two days are identical, here's a general sense of what an average day might look like:         Relate what you did yesterday, what you’re planning on doing today, where you got stuck, and how you got unstuck. Lots of clapping and feel-goods.Students are introduced to key programming skills in isolation, and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting. This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff, or visualise things using a board or visualisation technology if you're a remote student.Students pair with each other either in person or remotely throughout the morning, building real stuff using tools and practices we’d expect from a professional junior developer.Our cohorts tend to lunch together. Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditch’s fine local eateries and there's often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak to!Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and keeps your brain sharp.The afternoon is spent pair programming, as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculum.A pecha kucha night, a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer, a hosted event, or a film night...we love to organise stuff to keep your social bar topped up. If you're a remote student why not game together online? Or even meet up if you're near each other.             Read more about our Coaching style           In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, all students are required to complete a (very important!) part-time PreCourse, which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy. In the first week, we focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer; second, you'll tackle version control using Git and Github. This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges. The PreCourse requires a minimum of    hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse, the better. Each Friday during the PreCourse, we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students' learning and check in on their progress.The main topics of week   are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now, students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we start creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. The Friday challenge involves writing a simple object-oriented system of interacting classes.This week we delve into more complex test-driven development and object-oriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well. We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics: lambdas vs procs, composition vs inheritance, iterators and recursion. The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core library.By now, students are comfortable using Ruby and writing object-oriented code in a test-driven way. In week   we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to Heroku.It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. Students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. Finally, students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases. This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web development.Now that students can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about other front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Students begin learning their second language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web. The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the front-end of one of the most popular websites in the world.This week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace. Working on a set project in small groups, students will learn Git workflow, QA, Standups/Scrums, Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment. This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeks.In week   we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on Rails.Students expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning a front-end JavaScript framework.This week we consolidate our learning by building a full-stack project using everything we've learnt from the previous weeks. Agile, Git workflow, User Stories, and teamwork are revisited in another team based project.By now students are confident junior developers. To put their skills to their test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final project.Early in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible. This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.This week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team. They focus on honing life-long learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market. This could include technical tests, working on open-source code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with. For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs, this is a great week to start working on your MVP!We run cohorts every   weeks onsite and every    weeks remotely, and applications are highly competitive.

Remote students are encouraged to start engaging wih their local tech community and if another Remote student is near you, we encourage you to meet up and bond!Our mission is to teach as many people as possible to create amazing products using beautiful code. Since we started in early     , we’ve grown from two people to a team of twenty. We are not just colleagues: we’re a family. The Makers Academy team is a diverse bunch who work hard and play hard.           Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs.           Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market. At the same time, Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him   months and    hours a week to get through it. A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory, they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers, and something had to be done.         About   months after that conversation they started their first cohort ‐ in February      - creating Makers Academy - an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer, allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in   hyper-intensive months in London. Before we knew it, forcing people to move to London in order to learn to code felt far too limiting, so in February      we launched Makers Academy Remote, codenamed 'Ronin': a course that leverages everything we've learned at Makers Academy to help people all over the world learn to code - from the comfort of their own home.Makers Academy has now been going for over   years and has graduated over     students.Paul Graham, the tech startup visionary behind YCombinator coined the term Maker for those individuals that truly produce. The Makers Academy mission is to give every student the skills to call themselves a Maker.Makers Academy officially runs  am to  pm, Monday to Friday at the Makers Academy studio in Shoreditch at   -   Commercial St – right at the centre of the tech startup community, a few minutes away from Shoreditch High Street station and Google Campus. We welcome anyone who wants to arrange a visit to see how we operate.Absolutely. Programming expertise takes years to master, but that's not the point of Makers Academy. We want to give you a foundation so that you can be a top candidate for an entry-level position at a world class startup or technology company. Whether you're looking to change careers or you want to start your own startup but can't find a technical co-founder, Makers Academy is for you. To learn more about the underlying research, see this essay on Why Learning to Code is So Hard.At the moment we do not have a dedicated housing department but members of our team can assist you with finding short term accommodation in London. In the past students have used sites like Gumtree, Zoopla, Spareroom.co.uk and many others to find a house. In London it's pretty easy to find a room at short notice if you put your mind to it.Indeed we do. Sign up to our mailing list to be notified when tickets go on sale.The company was formed in November     , and we ran our first course in February     .Of course. Our doors are open for anyone to come and visit. Book an appointment with one of our team here.While we don't set specific limits on how many students we accept, typically about   % of applicants end up studying at Makers Academy. We have a rigorous selection process, designed to find the most capable, driven and passionate people, and we aren't afraid to turn people away if we don't think they have what it takes to succeed at Makers Academy. It's not called \"Oxbridge meets the Marines, but for Developers\" for nothing!After submitting your online application, we'll invite you for an interview. In the interview we'll ask a few questions and do a bit of simple pair programming. You have no need to be afraid - we're not testing to see if you can already code. We're testing to see how you handle stressful situations where you're navigating the unknown. It'll be fun - we promise!In truth, there isn't a huge amount you can do to improve your chances at the interview stage - other than following the instructions we give you and studying the materials that we recommend. It's designed to find people who have natural reasoning skills, bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code. We're not testing whether you've memorised syntax - we're testing whether you can follow instructions and have the passion to learn some basic code without our support. The following articles will help you develop the sorts of behaviours and skills we look for in a candidate:Having said that, if you do already have some coding experience, even if you only went through a few introductory tutorials, this will be to your advantage. We recommend the following resources to get started as a web developer, regardless of whether you want to join Makers Academy or not:The interview is designed to test how you think, rather than what you know, but going through ‘Learn to Program’ by Chris Pine or the ‘Ruby Essentials’ course on lynda.com will put you in a great position when it comes to the pair programming part of the interview.No. All you need is passion and the ability to unlearn the word 'quit'.Absolutely. Makers Academy is more than just learning how to program — it's learning how to be a developer. It's learning how to build your own prototypes. It's learning where to go to find answers. It's learning about what the atmosphere of working in a startup is really like. It's learning to be a Maker from some of the best Makers in the world.Absolutely. We’ve had students from all over Europe, the USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand and even Venezuela.We welcome International Students. We've had people join us from France, Germany, The USA, even South Africa. The course cost is the same wherever you're from and you apply in the normal way. We are not legally able to assist or advise on visa related issues, so we would advise you to obtain the services of a professional visa organisation.It’s a bit of a cliche that coding is all about Maths (Computer Science is Maths heavy… Writing code, not so much!). In reality, anything above If/Else statements and simple AND/OR logic is done largely by the computer. It’s more important that you have the right sort of mentality, that you’re comfortable working in ‘the unknown’ and that you aren’t afraid to fail. So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths, you’ve got everything you need.There is a huge spectrum of learning difficulties, and we would never generalize to say that any learning difficulty would make our course unattainable. We've had a number of students with dyslexia do very well on the course, but please feel free to get in touch to discuss your personal requirements. While we're not experts in this field, we will do everything we can to support anyone who is serious about learning to code.We don’t track the number specifically, but we’ve had students from all over Europe, the USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and even VenezuelaMakers Academy is taught by a cadre of world-class technologists and entrepreneurs. They have founded various technology startups and have decades of educational experience between them. In addition, Makers Academy brings in world class speakers from top London technology companies.Currently we only offer our full-time course because we don't believe we could deliver a world-class result on a part-time basis - yet. One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning. The   -week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and we're not yet certain how we could deliver that with a part-time regiment…but we're working on it. Stay tuned!No. Makers Academy will provide all of the equipment needed. That being said, feel free to bring your own laptop if you'd like as long as it's a Mac or a Linux (the software you'll be using is really hard to use on Microsoft Windows).By far the best way to learn to code in such a short amount of time is to live and breathe it. You would need to attend Makers Academy from  am- pm, Monday-Friday, for the    weeks that you're studying. Bear in mind that this is a minimum requirement - the more time you give to the course the better the results will be! If you absolutely cannot make it to London, we have a new full-time online program that mirrors our off-line course.Students will be at Makers Academy from  am until  pm (although many stay well into the evening), Monday through Friday for the duration of the    week course. We use a combination of self-study, class-based instruction, hands-on exercises and pair programming to give you a well-rounded overview of how to apply each new concept.Our agile approach means we improve our course and curriculum with each cohort, but you can get a flavour of the structure from our curriculum.Yes. We have developed a part time PreCourse that needs to be completed before starting the course. We focus on the foundations: command-line, version control and the basics of Ruby. The PreCourse requires an average of   -   hours per week to complete successfully.The fact that we’ve had over     students graduate from Makers Academy, and our track record in getting students hired at companies like BSkyB, Pivotal Labs, ThoughtWorks and many other top tech companies mean that YES, it is possible to learn to code in    Weeks. Make no mistake - it will be tough. It will take hard work and dedication, but if you really want it, it’s there to be had.The course doesn’t just focus on Ruby on Rails. You'll learn a number of languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and more, but you're right in saying that you will leave Makers Academy with Ruby as your strongest language. However, we focus much of our efforts on teaching you the skills to think like a Developer (note the capital D!), and our graduates have gone on to work in a number of programming languages after leaving Makers Academy.Towards the end of the course, students work in teams on a project. Everyone is invited to pitch an \"idea\" and after a couple of rounds of voting, we construct teams based on project choice. Two weeks later the team present their projects to friends and family as part of their graduation.While you’ll get a taste of many languages while studying, we offer one course and one course only, and Ruby forms its backbone. If you’re sure that you want to learn a language like Python or C# then the course may not be for you.We do touch on Agile working methodologies and even some Lean Startup principles, but this isn’t the main focus of the course, nor is design. You will learn some basic principles in all these areas, but this is primarily a course where you will learn to code.Our Net Promoter Score (as decided by feedback from all students over the past year) is   . The highest you can get is a    , and anything above    is considered to be ‘Excellent’.Out of around     students so far we have had around    drop out, for various reasons. We have an application/interview process at Makers Academy that is designed to only accept people who are serious about learning to code, but we can’t always get it right!There’s no such thing as too old! Our students are incredibly diverse - people of all ages, backgrounds, sectors and experiences - so we don’t have a maximum age limit. The one thing that has been constant with all of our applicants is a passion for coding, and a burning determination to succeed.No. Remote students are expected to commit to  am to  pm, Monday to Friday (at a minimum, but most work well into the evening to finish their work). We also set weekend project work to keep you engaged, so if you really want to get to a professional standard in just a few months, you really have to commit to it.Yes. The value of a full-time course is huge in comparison to a part-time course. We don’t offer a part-time option because it wouldn’t produce world class developers.You don’t get a qualification when graduating Makers Academy Remote, you get a job. To be an official educational institution and to offer qualifications, we would need to submit our curriculum to the government, which would then get locked down without the possibility of any changes. Accreditation guidelines say that you have to teach the same thing for a minimum of   year before you can apply for an official qualification. Well - a year in software development is a lifetime in other industries. We update our course materials every   weeks to fit the needs of the market and the needs of our hiring partners, so we do not and will never offer official accreditation. We don't care for fancy pieces of paper - we want you to leave the course with the ability to build real projects. That's our 'qualification'.We don’t have any requirements other than a passion for coding and a commitment to learning. You don’t need any academic qualifications or work experience - just demonstrate to us that you’re keen and capable.We run a new course every    weeks, and you can take a look at all of our upcoming cohorts at the bottom of this page.The interviews for Makers Academy Remote are done remotely, to mimic the learning environment you’ll be in. We’ll also send you across some learning materials to prepare for the interview, so remember to complete all of the content to give yourself the best chance of progressing to the next stage.The PreCourse is part time and is completed remotely. You need around    hours per week (including weekends) to complete the required work. Weekly progress is compulsory on the PreCourse, to make your way onto the full-time course.Definitely! Our course is designed to turn any coding beginner into a junior developer in    weeks, and then get you a job in a world-class tech company after you graduate. Sound too good to be true? It isn’t, we do it over and over again every    weeks. If you fancy a read, you can take a look at our graduate stories hereThe majority of our hiring partners are in London, but we’ve helped graduates get jobs all over the world. As we get more Remote students, we’ll be hand-picking the top tech employers across Europe to work with us.Makers Academy Remote costs £    . We've partnered with Finance my Future, PCDL and EdAid to offer financial support. Ask about this during your interview. Hint, you need to apply first!We offer scholarships from time to time, usually in partnership with another company. By far the best way to hear about these things is by signing up to our newsletter and keeping an eye out for any new opportunities.Whilst we do have some international students join Makers Academy Remote, because of time differences do bear in mind that we don’t recommend joining the course if you are located somewhere that is more than +/-  hours GMT. Feel free to drop us an email if you want to have a chat about this in greater detail.We cover a range of content that includes languages, libraries, processes and frameworks, such as -                    Front end - HTML CSS, JavaScript                    Back end - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS                    Databases - (DataMapper, SQL) and user management                    Object Oriented Programming                    Test Driven Development & Pair Programming                    Agile, and lots more!Absolutely. We want to help in any way that we can - be that helping a student find their first (or second or third) position or just merely providing advice. We have built an extensive alumni network for all graduates. We now have a full time team to look after all post course arrangements and ensure you get a job.While it's really complicated publishing our success metrics we're committed to fully supporting you until you're happy in your new job as a developer.No. Certifications would require us to bend our curriculum to a governing body, thus reducing our agility to teach what's most relevant and to stay at the bleeding edge of what's important to the technology community. Also, the employers pay little attention to certificates but they value the skills, so we focus on the latter.On average it takes  -  months to get a job after graduation.We train you to a level of proficiency that will allow you to build your own prototypes (if you’re an entrepreneur) or to get a job as Junior Developer.The tech landscape moves fast. There are jobs available in every language - from C and Java right through Python and Ruby to Node and Clojure. With demand for Devs growing an average of   % every year, and the supply of devs flatlining at  % YoY, the reality is that if you’re a good programmer, you’ll always be in demand.We don’t offer any formal support but most of the team have extensive experience in startups and we're happy to talk to the students about their ideas.There are a number of ways you can raise funds. Check our payments page to see how previous students have done this.Unfortunately not. We will however assist with making arrangements in any way that we can – feel free to email us with any questions or requests that you may have.Due to high demand for spaces, we ask that, once accepted, students pay a non-refundable £    deposit to lock-down their spot on the course. This is to ensure that every place is taken by someone who actually intends to study at Makers Academy. Many courses end up with a waiting list and it isn't fair on waiting students for people to reserve a spot and not show up.Once a student is accepted on to the course, their spot is held for    days. In this time the seat will not be offered to anyone else. If the deposit is not paid within    days their application will be automatically archived. As the course is very selective and highly popular it will most likely mean the seat will be offered to someone else.Books are kind of outdated in the fast-paced world of software development. You won't need any on the course but we can recommend some if you're really after some physical materials.Yes - we welcome payment in Bitcoin. If you want to do so, we can talk about how to do so when you come for an interview.We offer scholarships from time to time, usually in partnership with another company.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Makers Academy community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, mental and physical ability and criminal convictions.Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.

The following terms and conditions apply to all students accepted to study at Makers Academy (run by Makers Academy Limited (company number         ) of   -   Commercial St, London, E   LT). By applying for a Makers Academy course or paying a deposit against Makers Academy course fees you confirm acceptance of these terms and conditions as legally binding on you until successful completion by you of the course (unless terminated or cancelled earlier in accordance with these terms and conditions).Makers Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Makers Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course environment. We hope that our selection process means we will never have to do this, of course. Other than in the event of serious disruptive behavior we will seek to resolve any issues by way of coaching and dialogue before taking more serious steps.If, despite our careful selection process, we find (acting reasonably and having undertaken a thorough investigation) that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course. Provided we are satisfied, acting reasonably and taking all reasonable circumstances into consideration, that the student has made a good faith effort to succeed on the course we may choose to refund a pro-rata amount of the course fees paid by a student who is required to leave (based on the number of full weeks of the course remaining after the student was required to leave, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks) .In any other circumstances the terms of section   (“Payment of Fees if the course is not completed”) below will apply.Students will be required to comply with all rules and regulations of Makers Academy or the premises in which Makers Academy courses are held. Makers Academy reserves the right to exclude any student for failure to do so.Each Makers Academy course will last for    calendar weeks (Monday-Friday, including bank holidays), and Makers Academy may stipulate that up to one calendar day during that period is reserved for student self-study rather than tuition. In addition, Makers Academy courses will evolve. The content, structure and methods used in each course is subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the course that you attend may not be identical to previous courses, and, whilst it will be materially the same, may not be identical to that described on the Makers Academy website.Anyone accepted on a Makers Academy course is required to pay a non-refundable £    deposit to secure their place on the course, which will be deducted from the total course fees owed. Makers Academy operates a “first come first served” policy so once you have paid your deposit we will reserve a place for you on our next available course (subject to your payment of the course fees as described below).Following payment of the deposit, the student must pay    % of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Makers Academy’s bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of the course. The fee is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the ten days prior to the start of the course.If payment in full is not received by Makers Academy in its bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of a course Makers Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid his/her deposit.Makers Academy will direct students to the payment services provider used by Makers Academy so that the student can pay the deposit and course fees online. Alternatively, students can pay the deposit and course fees by bank transfer to Makers Academy’s nominated bank account.Third party providers may, from time to time, offer loans to prospective Makers Academy students. These providers are entirely independent of Makers Academy and Makers Academy assumes no responsibility or liability for the loans or services that they offer. In particular, students must undertake their own due diligence on each provider and the terms of any loans or services that they offer.If a student fails to complete a course, Makers Academy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge the student the full amount of fees outstanding (being the full course fee less the deposit paid) immediately following confirmation that the student will not be completing the course for any reason.  In exceptional circumstances Makers Academy may, in its sole discretion, agree to waive payment of part or all of the outstanding fees.Any deposit or course fee paid by a student in accordance with the payment plan selected by the student set out in section   above is non-refundable unless the course on which the student is enrolled is cancelled (whether prior to the course commencing, or after its commencement) by Makers Academy, in which case any course fee which has been paid by the student will be refunded in full.  If a course is temporarily suspended for a period of less than one month no course fees will be refunded. If a course is suspended for a period of longer than one month students enrolled on that course will be given the option of continuing the course when it resumes or receiving a pro-rata refund of course fees for the suspended part of the course (based on the number of full weeks of the course that were suspended, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks).Makers Academy may, at its discretion, require students to complete a PreCourse prior to the start of the full course for which course fees are payable.

It is envisaged that each PreCourse will last for    hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the relevant full course. If a student fails to complete the PreCourse, or Makers Academy reasonably determines that the student is not suitable to participate in the full course (including if he/she does not pass any final technical test set by Makers Academy), the student shall not be permitted to participate in the full course (and shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid).

It looks like you're using an old browser - here at Makers Academy we are always looking to use the most cutting-edge features the web offers     and unfortunately your browser doesn't allow us to do this. We know you can't always switch, but we strongly recommend using the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.     The following terms and conditions apply to all students accepted to study at Makers Academy (run by Makers Academy Limited (company number         ) of   -   Commercial St, London, E   LT). By applying for a Makers Academy course or paying a deposit against Makers Academy course fees you confirm acceptance of these terms and conditions as legally binding on you until successful completion by you of the course (unless terminated or cancelled earlier in accordance with these terms and conditions).Makers Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Makers Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course environment. We hope that our selection process means we will never have to do this, of course. Other than in the event of serious disruptive behavior we will seek to resolve any issues by way of coaching and dialogue before taking more serious steps.If, despite our careful selection process, we find (acting reasonably and having undertaken a thorough investigation) that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course. Provided we are satisfied, acting reasonably and taking all reasonable circumstances into consideration, that the student has made a good faith effort to succeed on the course we may choose to refund a pro-rata amount of the course fees paid by a student who is required to leave (based on the number of full weeks of the course remaining after the student was required to leave, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks). In any other circumstances the terms of section   (“Payment of Fees if the course is not completed”) below will apply.Students will be required to comply with all rules and regulations of Makers Academy or the premises in which Makers Academy courses are held. Makers Academy reserves the right to exclude any student for failure to do so.Each Makers Academy course will last for    calendar weeks (Monday-Friday, including bank holidays), and Makers Academy may stipulate that up to one calendar day during that period is reserved for student self-study rather than tuition. In addition, Makers Academy courses will evolve. The content, structure and methods used in each course is subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the course that you attend may not be identical to previous courses, and, whilst it will be materially the same, may not be identical to that described on the Makers Academy website.Anyone accepted on a Makers Academy course is required to pay a non-refundable £    deposit to secure their place on the course, which will be deducted from the total course fees owed. Makers Academy operates a “first come first served” policy so once you have paid your deposit we will reserve a place for you on our next available course (subject to your payment of the course fees as described below).Following payment of the deposit, students can choose one of two payment plans for course fees, as follows:The student must pay    % of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Makers Academy’s bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of the course. The fee is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the ten days prior to the start of the course.If payment in full is not received by Makers Academy in its bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of a course Makers Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid his/her deposit.Makers Academy will direct students to the payment services provider used by Makers Academy so that the student can pay the deposit and course fees online. Alternatively, students can pay the deposit and course fees by bank transfer to Makers Academy’s nominated bank account.Third party providers may, from time to time, offer loans to prospective Makers Academy students. These providers are entirely independent of Makers Academy and Makers Academy assumes no responsibility or liability for the loans or services that they offer. In particular, students must undertake their own due diligence on each provider and the terms of any loans or services that they offer.If a student fails to complete a course, Makers Academy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge the student the full amount of fees outstanding (being the full course fee less the deposit paid) immediately following confirmation that the student will not be completing the course for any reason.  In exceptional circumstances Makers Academy may, in its sole discretion, agree to waive payment of part or all of the outstanding fees.Any deposit or course fee paid by a student in accordance with the payment plan selected by the student set out in section   above is non-refundable unless the course on which the student is enrolled is cancelled (whether prior to the course commencing, or after its commencement) by Makers Academy, in which case any course fee which has been paid by the student will be refunded in full.  If a course is temporarily suspended for a period of less than one month no course fees will be refunded. If a course is suspended for a period of longer than one month students enrolled on that course will be given the option of continuing the course when it resumes or receiving a pro-rata refund of course fees for the suspended part of the course (based on the number of full weeks of the course that were suspended, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks).Makers Academy may, at its discretion, require students to complete a PreCourse prior to the start of the full course for which course fees are payable. This PreCourse will be provided at no additional cost to students and is intended to ensure that each student is suitable to participate in the full course. It is envisaged that each PreCourse will last for    hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the relevant full course. If a student fails to complete the PreCourse, or Makers Academy reasonably determines that the student is not suitable to participate in the full course (including if he/she does not pass any final technical test set by Makers Academy), the student shall not be permitted to participate in the full course (and shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid).           All students must have the right to study in the UK under applicable UK rules, and hold a current visa if necessary. A guide to these rules can be found at:           http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/         As a general rule you will not need a visa if you hold a passport issued by the UK or any other country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.Please note that Makers Academy is not currently an accredited institution for the purposes of the “student visitor” category.Students will be required to produce an EEA or Swiss passport on enrolment on a course.
