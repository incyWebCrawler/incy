The team decided to make a robot based on the Mars rover (  engines with continuous tracks). It was built from scratch, and you can control it via a Node.js server. The goal was to have a mobile first web app which could control several aspects of the rover (motor movement, claw, camera pan tilt bracket) over wifi.

The project visualises the moods of world regions based on tweets. Each word is analysed for emotional content using the AFINN database and given a score, e.g. +  for 'happy' and -  for 'sad'. The average score of a tweet determines its colour. Finally, the tweet is plotted on a HTML Canvas using the coordinates it was sent from.
